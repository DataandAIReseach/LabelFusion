role_prompt = "You are a political scientist who developed a theory to measure stereotypical, hegemonic masculinity in presidential speeches."

theory_background = "Stereotypical and hegemonic masculinity represents a political approach rooted in a patriarchal social structure of beliefs and hierarchical values. The notion of masculinity as “hegemonic” pertains to the hierarchy of masculine traits, where hegemonic masculinity is regarded as the most desirable form. 1 The term “stereotypical” signifies characteristics that are assumed as typical within the patriarchal structure, although these traits might be more exaggerated than realistic. The masculinity discussed in this paper always embodies both hegemonic and stereotypical aspects."
