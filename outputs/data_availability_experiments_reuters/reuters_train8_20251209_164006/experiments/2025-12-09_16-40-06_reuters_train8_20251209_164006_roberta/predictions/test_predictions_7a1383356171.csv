      The measure, however, does not require President Reagan to

  for a resolution to be passed in the House and Senate on the
  situation in the volatile waterway 30 days later.
      The resolution could be about any Gulf-related issue,
  including an expression of support or of disapproval for
  Reagan's policy of protecting 11 Kuwaiti tankers from Iran in
  the waterway. The Pentagon said the 12th U.S.-protected convoy

  Rio Tinto-Zinc Corp Plc &lt;RTZL.L>, RTZ,
  said the predicted rise in industrial production in the U.S.
  And Europe should boost its 1987 performance.
      Consumption of some base metals and their dlr prices are
  showing signs of improvement, although iron ore markets have
  weakened. The oil price in U.S. Dlrs is above the 1986 average,
  and if sustained, should improve energy earnings.
      The company was commenting in a statement on its 1986
  results which, on a restated basis, showed net attributable
  profits lower at 245 mln stg after 257 mln the previous year.
  Pretax profits also dipped to 601.7 mln stg after 614.4 mln.
      RTZ said the excellent performance of its expanding range
  of industrial businesses in 1986 was offset by the collapse in
  oil prices.
      Industrial businesses contributed 202 mln stg to net
  profit, a 40 pct increase from 144 mln in 1985, and 60 pct of
  the total. Trading performance improved at wholly-owned

  reported a parent company net profit up 34.8 pct to 140.1 mln
  francs from 103.9 mln francs a few weeks before its
  denationalisation around the end of this month.
      Official sources said the bank, France's sixth largest in
  terms of its deposits and seventh in terms of its assets,
  
  planned a share split to increase the number of shares on offer
  ahead of the sale of 40 pct of its ordinary share capital to
  the public, of 10 pct to staff and 20 pct abroad.
      Previously one of France's biggest private banks, it was
  nationalised by the Socialists in 1982.
      The sources said it was too early to give details of the
  planned split or of the share price, but cited April 27 as a
  likely date for the flotation launch.
      So far 30 pct of the group's capital, currently at 10.33
  mln shares of 100 francs nominal, has been offered for sale to
  large private investors to constitute a solid core of eight to
  ten shareholders before the flotation.
      The private tender offer closes on April 16, while a 12 mln
  franc advertising campaign for the flotation begins on Sunday.

  CCF deputy director-general Rene de la Serre told Reuters.

  the same number of investors as &lt;Sogenal>, another recently

  The Federal Reserve will promote lower
  interest rates this year to sustain world economic growth,
  First Boston Corp managing director Albert Wojnilower said.
      As much as the Fed would like to take a tough line against
  inflation, it cannot act to slow the growth of credit without
  subverting national U.S. economic policy.
      ""On selected occasions when the dollar seems steady, and,
  because the trade deficit is not responding, the United States
  decided to push Germany and Japan harder to meet their
  commitments to economic growth, the Federal Reserve will do its
  part by moving rates down,"" Wojnilower said in a report.
      ""Justifiably not anticipating either a recession or
  seriously higher interest rates, securities market participants
  have seen little to fear,"" Wojnilower said.
      He said last week's ""hiccup"" in money and currency rates
  and bond and stock prices was probably caused by Japanese
  window dressing for March 31 end-of-fiscal-year accounts.
      Wojnilower said the U.S. probably enjoyed above-average
  economic growth in the first quarter. However, the pick-up
  seems to reflect an unsustainable pace of inventory building
  and the prospect for the full year is still for real gross
  national product growth of about 2-1/2 pct, he said.

test/17952,"KUWAITI DINAR RATES FIRM, AID WINDOW OPEN
  Interest rates on Kuwaiti dinar deposits
  held firm in scattered trading despite a Central Bank decision
  to revive limited funding lines, dealers said.
      The Central Bank, which last Tuesday shut a daily aid
  window through which it lent funds of up to one year, reopened
  the facility for three month money, which was available at
  seven pct, they said.
      It offered one month funds at seven pct through swap
  facilities, dealers said.
      Today's Central Bank action, combined with sales of dollars
  by some banks, helped ease a recent credit squeeze engineered
  by the monetary authority to stem a rush for the U.S. Currency
  arising from attractive U.S. Interest rates and Gulf tension,
  dealers said.
      However, as one dealer noted: ""The market is still
  unsettled.""
      Overnight funds, bid at 20 pct at the outset of business,
  traded up to 30 pct before easing as liquidity dragged offers
  down to 10 pct by the close. Tomorrow-next, for which buy/sell
  quotes started at 30, 20 pct, ended at 14, eight.
      Spot-next was indicated at 8-1/2, seven after opening bids
  of 10. Dealers quoted one-week at eight, seven against an early
  9-1/2, 7-1/2.
      One month rates were at the same level after trade at eight
  then 8-1/2. Dealers quoted three months at seven, 6-3/4 pct and
  six-month to one year funds at seven, six pct. They reported
  offshore offers of overnight at 10, tomorrow-next at eight and
  one year at 6-1/2 pct towards the close.
       The Central Bank fixed its dinar exchange rate steady at
  0.27933/67 to the dollar, against yesterday's 0.27939/73. The
  spot dinar was 0.27930/40.

      Hard red spring wheat accounts for most acreage with 6.0
  mln estimated for this year, little changed from last year.
  Oats acreage of 1.95 mln is unchanged on last year and barley
  area of 5.9 mln is also similar to last year. Rapeseed planting
  of an estimated 3.24 mln is expected five pct up on 1986. The
  south and south central areas of Alberta lacked moisture with
  germination patchy at best. Growth prospects in northern areas
  are generally in the good to very good range.
     Soil moisture is better in the north central and Peace
  areas, the wheat pool said.

test/19509,"NORWAY EXTENDS 7.5 PCT OIL OUTPUT CUT - MINISTRY
  Norway will extend its 7.5 pct cutback in
  planned North Sea oil output in support of OPEC from July 15
  until the end of this year, Oil Ministry spokesman Egil Helle
  told Reuters.
      ""We took a very positive view of the OPEC meeting in Vienna,""
  he said. ""The accord reached there means stability in the oil
  market and we shall continue making our contribution.""
      The cuts, originally brought in from February 1, would
  probably be officially approved on July 10 by parliament, Helle
  said. The ministry had written to Norway's oil companies and
  would now discuss with them how best to implement the cuts.
      OPEC agreed this weekend in Vienna on an output ceiling of
  16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of 1987 and
  retained the fixed prices that were set in its December accord
  based on an 18 dlr per barrel reference point.
      OPEC's first half 1987 output ceiling was 15.8 mln bpd, and
  it's December pact had provisionally set a third quarter
  ceiling of 16.6 mln bpd, rising to 18.3 mln in the fourth
  quarter.
      Norway, which pumps around one mln bpd from its offshore
  fields, previously said it would continue its output curbs from
  planned production for the rest of the year if OPEC remained
  within its December accord on output and prices.
      Norway's oil production rose 10 pct to an average of around
  840,000 bpd in 1986. Since then it has risen to around one mln
  bpd, and is expected to reach about 1.5 mln bpd by 1995.
      The 7.5 pct cut from planned production implemented since
  February reduced Norway's oil output by about 80,000 bpd.
      Norway's Oil Minister Arne Oeien, currently in Iceland for
  a meeting of Nordic ministers, has made no official statement
  on the latest oil production cutbacks.
      Over the past year several other leading non-OPEC
  producers, including the Soviet Union, Mexico, China, Malaysia
  and Egypt have also pledged support for OPEC's bid to keep
  prices stable.
      Norway decided on the initial round of cuts following an
  OPEC agreement last December which boosted oil prices to around
  18 dlrs per barrel from around 14 to 15 dlrs last December.
      Norway relies on oil for about 40 pct of its total export
  earnings and was hit hard by the collapse in the oil price
  during the first half of 1986.
      But firmer oil prices since then have brought some
  stability to the economy and helped narrow the foreign trade
  deficit.
       Norway's North Sea neighbour Britain has consistently
  refused to cooperate with OPEC output cuts saying it is up to
  the producing oil companies to set the levels of production.

  Showboat Inc will take a
  charge of 19 to 20 mln dlrs pretax against results for the
  third quarter ended March 31, director and assistant to the
  president J. Kell Houssels III told Reuters.
      He said the charge results from pre-operating expenses of
  its recently-opened Atlantic City, N.J., Showboat Hotel, Casino
  and Bowling Center and will cause a loss for the third quarter
  and probably for all of fiscal 1987 as well.
      But Houssels said Showboat's earnings for fiscal 1988
  should show a sharp increase from fiscal 1986 levels due to the
  contribution of the new Atlantic City facility.
      Showboat earned 1,753,000 dlrs in last year's third
  quarter.  For all of fiscal 1986 it earned 5,769,000 dlrs.
      Houssels said Showboat since the opening of the Atlantic
  City hotel/casino, Showboat has had to start charging interest
  expenses connected with debt it sold to finance the facility
  directly against income rather than capitalizing the interest
  as it had been able to do previously.
      Showboat opened the hotel during its third quarter and
  gaming began last Thursday on a regular basis after test gaming
  was completed earlier in the week.

  The south China province of Guangdong is
  importing millions of tonnes of grain a year from overseas and
  other parts of China because farmers have switched from grain
  to more profitable crops, the Peking Review magazine said.
      The official magazine said the province's grain area fell
  to 4.33 mln hectares in 1985 from 5.7 mln in 1978 out of a
  total farmland area of 7.4 mln hectares.
      Farmers have switched to cash crops such as sugarcane,
  bananas, oranges, papaya and freshwater fish-farming, in part
  to supply major consumer markets in Hong Kong and Macao, the
  magazine said. It gave no 1986 area figures.
      The magazine said China aims to keep 80 pct of national
  farmland under grain, 10 pct under cash crops and 10 pct under
  other crops, although the ratio will vary from place to place.
      It said primitive cultivation methods, labour-intensity and
  low productivity make grain the least profitable farm
  commodity. Farmers in one central region of China can from 0.1
  hectare earn 2,250 yuan a year from vegetables, 375-450 yuan
  from cotton or 225 yuan from grain, it added.
      It said consumer prices for foodgrain can be adjusted only
  gradually as part of a reform of the entire pricing system.

      He said preliminary tests showed that the well could flow
  oil at the rate of 1,320 barrels a day with 50 degrees API at

  Tug crews in New South Wales (NSW),
  Victoria and Western Australia yesterday lifted their ban on
  foreign-flag ships carrying containers but NSW ports are still
  being disrupted by a separate dispute, shipping sources said.
      The ban, imposed a week ago over a pay claim, had prevented
  the movement in or out of port of nearly 20 vessels, they said.
  The pay dispute went before a hearing of the Arbitration
  Commission today.
      Meanwhile, disruption began today to cargo handling in the
  ports of Sydney, Newcastle and Port Kembla, they said.
      The industrial action at the NSW ports is part of the week
  of action called by the NSW Trades and Labour Council to
  protest changes to the state's workers' compensation laws.

test/15617,"LAWSON SAYS SOME COUNTRIES COULD CUT RATES
  Nigel Lawson, Britain's Chancellor of
  the Exchequer, said some countries may need to cut interest
  rates with the aim of maintaining exchange rate stability.
      Speaking to journalists one day after the Group of Seven
  countries reaffirmed goals set in Paris six weeks ago, he said
  central banks would continue to intervene ""as and when
  necessary.""
      He said the G-7 countries were concerned that Japan do more
  to stimulate domestic demand and welcomed measures outlined by
  Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa yesterday.
      Lawson said he was still worried about  the risk of a
  simultaneous recession in the United States, Japan and West
  Germany, though less so than when he gave his March 17 budget
  speech to the British Parliament.
      ""If anything I'm a little bit less concerned, but there is
  still a risk,"" he said.
      Asked if the United States should consider increasing
  interest rates to support the dollar, he said, ""If there is a
  need for changes in relative interest rates, it doesn't need to
  be a rise in interest rates in the United States.""
      Lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday's
  meetings at the slow progress the United States had made in
  reducing its budget deficit.
      ""We believe there will be some worthwhile progress in
  reducing the deficit this year. The important thing is that it
  continue year after year,"" Lawson said.
      The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts to
  stabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the six
  weeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise against
  the dollar despite massive central bank intervention.
      Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness in
  the Louvre accord, he said, ""I don't think so. If there had been
  no intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness.""
      Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawson
  said, ""the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode
  ... but one has to be vigilant.""
      He said yesterday's G-7 statement, which affirmed that
  ""current levels"" of exchange rates were appropriate, had been
  ""carefully worded."" ""We know what we mean, and we all mean the
  same thing,"" he said.
      Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanese
  measures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source of
  weakness for that agreement.
      Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa's
  presentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulate
  domestic demand.
      They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediate
  increase in public works spending, but Lawson said the package
  also involved a second stage to increase expenditures during
  the second half of this year.

  The Belgian National Bank said it cut
  one, two, and three month treasury certificate rates, all by
  0.10 points, effective immediately.
      The cuts take the one month rate to 6.75 pct, the two month
  rate to 6.80 pct and the key three month rate to 6.85 pct, the
  central bank said in a telex.
      A National Bank spokesman said the modest cut was made
  after a decline in domestic money market rates yesterday, and
  was not expected to be followed by a cut in the 7.60 pct
  discount rate.
      The short-term treasury certificate rates, and especially
  the three-month rate, have been the National Bank's main
  monetary policy instrument for the last two years.
      The discount rate has been the market's penalty rate rather
  than a guiding rate since 1985, and its advances are currently
  little used as liquidity is ample, bank economists said.
      The bank last cut one- to three-month certificate rates on
  June 5, also by 0.10 points.

test/17478,"PEMEX OFFICIAL SAYS OPEC OUTPUT CRITICAL TO PRICE
  Crude oil prices could remain around 18
  dlrs a barrel until the end of the year, but OPEC's decision on
  output at its next meeting would be the critical factor, an
  official of Mexico's state oil company, Petroleos Mexicanos
  (Pemex), told a group of Japanese businessmen.
      Adrian Lajous, Pemex' executive vice president of
  international trade, said current OPEC output already appeared
  to be very near the 16.6 mln barrel per day level it set itself
  for the third quarter. ""Production is surging ahead of what was
  originally planned, while demand is growing more slowly than
  envisaged a few months ago,"" he said.
      He said OPEC had to look very carefully at what level of
  production in the third quarter would effectively sustain the
  18 dlrs price, and that an increase to what had originally been
  envisaged might soften price levels.
      The 13-member cartel is scheduled to meet on June 25 in
  Vienna to review its December accord on prices and output.
      ""I hope OPEC will follow a very conservative attitude in
  terms of volume decisions,"" Lajous said.
      A repetition of what happened last year, when OPEC boosted
  output and sent oil prices tumbling down below 10 dlrs, is
  always there as a possibility, he said.
      ""I hope never again to go through the trauma of 1986. I
  expect other oil exporters have learned their lessons and
  discipline will be maintained,"" he said.
      Lajous said there was still excess supply and as long as
  this remains there will be a tendency to instability in oil
  markets, but prices should remain around 18 to 19 dlrs during
  1987 if output remains under control.
      He said Saudi King Fahd's remarks last month, that
  increased production was not so important as long as incomes
  would not be affected by the output, were ""very relevant and
  welcome from such a powerful producer.""

  Canada just like the foreign investment that made possible

      Amoco Canada president T. Don Stacy told an oilsands

  Dome problem, and we're investing our confidence, dollars and

      The Amoco buyout of debt-burdened Dome has angered Canadian
  nationalists, who want a Canadian buyer for Dome.
      Stacy described Amoco Canada's previously reported share
  offer proposal as a chance to increase Canadian ownership of
  the country's oil and gas industry, now at about 50 pct.
      He reiterated that Amoco planned virtually no layoffs of
  Dome employees. He also reaffirmed that Amoco would reinvest in

      Santos said the move had been explained to fellow OPEC
  members during last week's meeting in Vienna, when an increase
  in Ecuador's quota to 221,000 bpd from 210,000 was approved.
      ""They understood our position and we believe we remain
  within the spirit of the (quota) agreement,"" he said.
      Immediately before the March quake Ecuadorean production
  was 250,000-260,000 bpd, with 144,000 bpd exported.
      While its production was down, Venezuela, Nigeria and
  Kuwait loaned Ecuador a total 12 mln barrels of crude and four
  mln barrels of products, Santos said.

  The Administration asked Congress to

  Representative Clayton Yeutter said.
      The new system will add such items as fiber optics and more
  accurately define new composites, items not widely traded when
  the current schedule was devised some 30 years ago.
      Yeutter said the Harmonized System, as the new schedule is
  called, will change tariff categories and definitions to meet
  the present-day needs of exporters and importers, but they
  should pay about the same rates of duties.
      Yeutter said, ""American exporters will find it far easier to
  deal with one standardized worldwide system than the variety of
  differing systems which they now face.""
      He said the new system ended 12 years of multinational
  negotiations to create the unified tariff schedule.
      Yeutter said government and business moves are based on
  data from tariff schedules and the new system will improve
  knowledge of trade flows and the quality of decision-making.
      He said 56 nations pledged to bring their standards under
  the new system, with about half expected to join the system by
  January 1988.

      A similar measure was decisively defeated on the Senate
  floor last week.
      The bill, which passed by a voice vote, would allow
  so-called Findley payments to be made immediately rather than
  late this year. Payments for 1987-90 feedgrains crops would not
  be changed.
      Because the bill would move 2.8 billion dlrs of spending

       It said Reebok filed a registration statement with the

  shares of Reebok common. Reebok will sell three mln shares and

      After the offering, Reebok will have 56.1 mln shares shares
  outstanding.
      Pentland said the amount of the capital gain from the sale
  depends on the offering price for the Reebok shares to be
  negotiated between it, Reebok, and the other selling
  stockholders who will offer about 1.6 mln shares of Reebok
  common, and the underwriters.
      Pentland said proceeds from the offering will be used by

  will have bank credit lines available for general corporate

      Reebok's stock was selling at 45-1/2, up 1/8. At that

  about 64 mln dlrs and the three mln shares Reebok will sell are
  worth about 136.5 mln dlrs.
      Pentland said it will use proceeds to fund growth and

      Pentland said 4,500,000 shares of Rebbok will be offered in
  the U.S. by a syndicate led by Kidder, Peabody and Co Inc and
  1,500,000 shares will be offered outside the U.S. by an

test/20001,"IF DOLLAR FOLLOWS WALL STREET JAPANESE WILL DIVEST
  If the dollar goes the way of Wall Street,
  Japanese will finally move out of dollar investments in a
  serious way, Japan investment managers say.
      The Japanese, the dominant foreign investors in U.S. Dollar
  securities, have already sold U.S. Equities.
      But ""if the dollar falls steeply, which did not happen
  yesterday, Japanese investors will definitely try to withdraw
  significant funds from U.S. Shares,"" said Akira Kawakami, deputy
  manager of Nomura Investment Trust and Management Co Ltd's
  international investment department.
      An unstable, lower dollar would also affect Japanese
  investment in U.S. Bonds. ""Japan-U.S. Interest rate
  differentials, which currently look wide enough, mean nothing
  in the absence of dollar stability,"" said Kawakami.
      U.S. Bonds could benefit due to a gloomy economic picture
  following the estimated huge losses in stocks by major U.S.
  Institutional and individual investors, he said. The effect
  should be to rule out any U.S. Interest rate rise.
      But most Japanese investors in U.S. Bonds are still wiating
  to see if the dollar really is stable, he said. The dollar was
  holding firm at above 142 yen on Tuesday morning.
      ""Although Japanese investors sold huge amounts of stocks in
  New York yesterday, most are still looking for chances to
  lighten their U.S. Stock inventories,"" Hiromitsu Sunada, manager
  of Meiji Mutual Life Insurance Co's international investment
  department said.
      Their sales helped send Wall Street stocks down 508 points
  to 1,738, the market's biggest percentage drop since 1914.
      ""Investment in U.S. Stocks and bonds is difficult,
  considering the dangers,"" said Katsuhiko Okiyama, deputy general
  manager and chief adviser of Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd's fixed
  income securities marketing group.
      Japanese investment at home could start to pick up once
  markets have stopped reacting to Wall Street, the managers
  said. The Tokyo yen bond market is likely to stabilise in one
  or two weeks, which is what investors have been waiting for.
  The bottom for yen bonds should be around a 6.3 pct yield for
  the 5.1 pct 89th bond, they said.
      ""The basic background which has supported the stocks and
  bonds markets has not changed,"" said Norio Okutsu, assistant
  general manager of Nikko Securities' bond department. ""But new
  outflows of funds to the U.S. Will be decreasing.""  However,
  this was already evident three months ago, he said.

test/18774,"U.K. COURT RULES AGAINST RTZ ON OIL FIELD COSTS
  The U.K. High Court dismissed an appeal
  by Rio Tinto-Zinc Corp Plc's &lt;RTZL.L> RTZ Oil and Gas Ltd unit
  and ruled that the financial provisions a company makes for the
  future cost of abandoning an oil field are not tax deductible,
  the Press Association reported.
      The company was appealing against a decision of the Tax
  Commissioners that any such provision was a capital
  expenditure, not a revenue expenditure, and was not deductible.
  The court was told that since 1976 the company had made an
  annual provision of around 750,000 stg for the eventual cost of
  abandoning a rig.
      An RTZ spokesman said the ruling was not worrying as the
  subsidiary had assumed that the provisions were not deductible
  from corporation tax payable.
      It would have been a bonus if the company had won but all
  budgeting had been on the assumption that it would not, he
  said.
      Oil analysts said that RTZ's assumption of liability was
  shared by the industry as a whole.
      The ruling appeared to mean that tax relief on the
  expensive process of abandoning rigs would apply when the
  expense occurred, not when provisions for future expenses were
  built into the accounts, one analyst added.

test/17700,"COMPUTER ASSOC. &lt;CA> BOLSTERS HAND AGAINST IBM
  Computer Associates International Inc's
  800 mln dlr merger with Uccel Corp &lt;UCE> will eliminate its
  strongest rival, but the company still faces stiff competition
  from International Business Machines Corp &lt;IBM>, Wall Street
  analysts said.
       ""IBM is still the ruling force in mainframe systems
  software,"" said Scott Smith, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin
  and Jenrette.
      ""But the combination of the two companies will clearly
  present a much stronger front,"" he said.
      Besides IBM, ""Computer Associates will be far and away the
  most powerful company in the field,"" added E.F. Hutton analyst
  Terence Quinn.
      That field is a segment of the market known as system
  utilities, or software packages that boost the productivity of
  a company's data processing facilities by increasing the speed,
  power and efficiency of large mainframe computers.
      The merger of Uccel and Computer Associates combines the
  two biggest systems utilities suppliers other than IBM.
  Analysts said the remaining players are mostly small firms that
  will find the competition much harder than in the past.
      For Computer Associates, the merger with Uccel caps a
  six-year acquisition campaign that has vaulted the Garden City,
  N.Y.-based company to the top of the software industry.
      When the deal is completed sometime in August, the
  company's revenues will exceed 450 mln dlrs, pushing it past 
  Microsoft Corp &lt;MFST> as the world's largest independent
  software vendor.
      Computer Associates founder and chairman Charles B. Wang
  took the company public in 1981, and since then he has bought
  15 companies and boosted annual sales from 18.5 mln to 309.3
  mln dlrs for the year ended March 31.
      Liemandt took charge of Wyly, sold off its non-computer
  businesses and decided that it would focus solely on mainframe
  computer software. In 1984, the company was renamed Uccel Corp.
      Liemandt, who said he will leave the company after the
  merger is completed, also turned to acquisitions for growth.
      On the last day of 1986, Uccel completed the buyouts of six
  companies for a total of about 60 mln dlrs.
      For 1986, it earned 17.0 mln dlrs, or 1.01 dlrs a share, on
  sales of 141.5 mln dlrs.
      The agreement took industry analysts by surprise, largely
  because the companies had been such bitter rivals. Also,
  Dallas-based Uccel had engineered a strong comeback from the
  dark days of 1982, when, as Wyly Corp, it lost 7.7 mln dlrs, or
  56 cts a share.
     At that time, Wyly owned a potpourri of 13 different
  businesses, only three of which were involved in computer
  software. In 1983, Walter Haefner, a Swiss financier and a
  major Wyly investor, lured Gregory J. Liemandt away from his
  job as chairman of General Electric Co's &lt;GE> computer services
  unit.
      Computer Associates' Wang and Uccel's Liemandt said at a
  news conference that the merger would give computer users a
  single source for a wide range of software products.
      In addition to system utilities, Computer Associates also
  sell products for microcomputers, while Uccel has made inroads
  in the applications software market, where analysts said it has
  been successful with accounting and banking systems.
      Wang said Computer Associates would continue to support and
  enhance both companies' product lines, but noted that the
  company will eventually weed out duplicate offerings. He said
  about 20 pct of the companies' products overlap.
      Analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings of
  current Computer Associates shareholders by about 10 pct. But
  they joined Wang in forecasting that the deal will not dilute
  Computer Associates' earnings for the current fiscal year.
      Quinn of E.F. Hutton said Wang has a proven track record of
  completing acquisitions without earnings dilution. Therefore,
  he said he would not change his 1988 earnings estimate of 1.05
  dlrs a share.
      Wang said he would look closely at the combined operations
  of the two companies and cut duplication in sales, marketing
  and research and development.
      Analysts said Computer Associates paid a premium for Uccel.
  Based on Friday's closing price, the company will swap 47.50
  dlrs worth of its stock for each Uccel share, which is nearly
  33 times Uccel's 1987 estimated earnings of 1.45 dlrs a share.
      Stephen T. McClellan of Merrill Lynch Research said most
  software companies are currently valued at about 20 times
  per-share earnings. But the analyst said Uccel was worth the
  premium because of its earnings potential and customer base.
  
      Wang said Haefner, the Swiss investor, would hold about 25
  pct of Computer Associates stock after the merger. He currently
  owns 58 pct of Uccel.
      The executive said the merger would not alter his target of
  maintaining sales and earnings growth of 30 pct to 35 pct.
      In addition, he said he expects no problems in having the
  deal cleared by the antitrust division of the U.S. Justice
  Department.
      Uccel's Liemandt declined to say what he will do after the
  merger, but he did not rule out working together with Wang.

test/16216,"SOSNOFF RAISES BID FOR CAESARS WORLD &lt;CAW>
  Investor Martin T. Sosnoff said he has
  raised his offer for Caesars World Inc shares to 32 dlrs each
  from 28 dlrs and has reduced the number of shares he is seeking
  to 29.1 mln from all those not already owned.
      In a newspaper advertisement, Sosnoff said the bid by his
  MTS Acquisition Corp, withdrawal rights and the proration
  period will now expire June 19 unless extended. The offer had
  been scheduled to expire May 15. In late March, Sosnoff said he
  had received a ""negligible"" number of shares in response to the
  offer, which had been rejected by Caesars as inadequate.
      Sosnoff already owns about four mln of Caesars' 30 mln
  common shares now outstanding, or a 13.3 pct interest on a
  primary basis.
      Last week, Caesars' board approved a recapitalization plan
  as an alternative to the Sosnoff offer under which shareholders
  would receive a special dividend of 25 dlrs per share, subject
  to approval by shareholders at a special meeting to be held in
  June.
      The company planned to borrow 200 mln dlrs and sell 800 mln
  dlrs in debt to finance the payout.
      Sosnoff said in the newspaper advertisement that the
  amended offer is conditioned on receipt of enough shares to
  give him a majority interest on a fully diluted basis and on
  the arrangement of financing, as well as to approvals by New
  Jersey and Nevada gaming authorities.
      He said the tender would be the first step in acquiring all
  of Caesars' shares and if successful would be followed by a
  merger transaction.
      Sosnoff said later in a statement that the 29.1 mln shares
  he is now seeking, together with the 4,217,675 shares he owns,
  would give him a 92.4 pct interest on a fully diluted basis.
      He said he still has received only a ""negligible"" number of
  shares in response to his tender.
      In a letter to Caesars' chairman Henry Gluck included in
  the statement, Sosnoff said Gluck had again refused, on April
  8, to meet with him, even though he had said he was willing to
  increase the price of his offer.
      Sosnoff said the financing for the offer is almost fully in
  place.
      Sosnoff said PaineWebber Group Inc &lt;PWJ> has now delivered
  to him commitments to purchase up to 475 mln dlrs of increasing
  dividend cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of MTS Holding
  Corp, an indirect parent corporation of MTS Acquisition.
      He said Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM>, which leads a
  syndicate that has provided commitments for a 500 mln dlr
  margin facility, believes it will be able to arrange for
  further commitments under the margin facility to advance up to
  an additional 25 mln dlrs that may be needed to permit the
  purchase of shares under the offer.
      Sosnoff said under the merger that would follow his tender,
  each of the 2,750,000 Caesars shares not covered by the offer,
  or 7.6 pct on a fully diluted basis, would be converted into
  Series A preferred stock valued at 32 dlrs per shareby an
  independent investment baking firm.
      He said ""To the extent that fewer than 29,100,000 sdhares
  are purchased in the offer, the stockholders would receive a
  combination of cash and Series A preferred stock having a value
  of 32 dlrs per share of Caesars.""
      Sosnoff said he believes terms of his offer are superior to
  Caesars' recapitalization.
      Sosnoff said he will be meeting this week with gaming
  officials in Nevada in an effort to expedite the investigatory
  process required for regulatory approval, a process that it
  already underway in New Jersey.
      He said his offer has been extended based on the likely
  duration of the regulatory process.
      He said he intends to further extend the offer if the
  approval process is not completed by the expiration date.

      Stad Rotterdam's premium income in 1986 was 1.17 billion

      The Canadians postponed the original July 1 deadline at the

test/15352,"DEFICIT CUTS SEEN UNABLE TO CURE TRADE DEFICIT
  Financial analysts say they are
  pleased with congressional moves to trim next year's federal
  budget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help
  improve the U.S. trade deficit or buoy the economy.
      The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrow
  to approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the coming
  fiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs.
      Similarly, the Senate Budget Committee has approved a plan
  that would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs next
  year.
          ""In terms of the economy, 37-38 billion dlrs is
  infinitesimal, so cuts of this magnitude will have little
  impact on the economy and the trade deficit,"" said Stanley
  Collander, a Touche Ross federal budget policy analyst.
      ""At best, it will have a small positive effect,"" Collander
  said in an interview.
      Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has repeatedly
  told Congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long way
  to help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease
  some of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar.
      The U.S. government has attempted to remedy the trade
  imbalance by driving down the value of the dollar. But Volcker
  has warned that a further fall in the dollar's value is fraught
  with danger.
      Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation as
  imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign
  capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.
      In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with other
  major industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of
  the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates
  should be stabilized at around current levels.
      As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed to
  take steps to stimulate their economies and the United States
  agreed to cut its budget deficit.
      The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a
  way to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, is
  to reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending.
      ""If you don't deal with the budget deficit, everything else
  you do is going to be counterproductive,"" Volcker said in recent
  testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.
      Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the
  government's purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit
  supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or
  to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United
  States.
      Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the
  current modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.
      Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed
  that any deficit reduction was better than none.
      But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were 
  not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it
  needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar
  from plunging further in world exchange markets.
      ""There's no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but if
  your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the
  Fed's flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answer
  is, it's not enough,"" Silvia told Reuters.
      The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government's
  most vexing and persistent problems.
      The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yet
  little indication that this year's figure will be any lower,
  though administration officials have predicted it will drop by
  about 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year's end.
      In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep
  worrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the
  federal budget.
      On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is not
  attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for
  the 1986-1991 period by last year's Gramm-Rudman balanced
  budget law.
      While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for
  next year's federal deficit, both the House and Senate Budget
  Committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall
  short of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.
      ""For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the
  most you're going to get"" out of Congress at the present time,
  said Touche Ross's Collander. ""To do something more than that
  would be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult.""
      Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up
  short of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels.
      ""To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptable
  reduction level,"" he explained. ""Anything less than that will now
  look like a failure to Wall Street.""
      The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would
  lower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year
  beginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting
  defense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their
  anticipated spending levels for next year.
      The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit of
  nearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new 
  taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts.

test/19947,"PAKISTAN UNVEILS NEW TRADE POLICY TO BOOST EXPORTS
  Pakistani government allowed freer
  cotton and rice export in a three-year new trade policy aimed
  at narrowing the country's yawning trade gap.
      Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a
  televised speech the government had also decided to allow
  duty-free import of cotton yarn to make the textile industry
  more competitive, and to link bulk tea imports to the export of
  Pakistani products.
     
      Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which have
  been handled exclusively by state corporations since early
  1970s.
      But Haq said now the private sector would also export
  cotton and rice along with the corporations, which meets a
  long-standing demand of the local traders.
      The duty-free import of cotton yarn has been allowed to
  bring down prices and help the local ancillary industries
  compete effectively in the world market, he said.
     
      Haq said the new policy, effective from the fiscal year
  1987/88 beginning on July 1, would be for three years but
  reviewed every year.
      It was a departure from the previous practice of announcing
  trade policies for a single fiscal year, and Haq said it would
  enable the businessmen to plan their market strategies over a
  longer period.
      He said an export credit of 250 mln dlrs had been provided
  for the export of engineering goods to selected third world
  countries on soft credit terms.
     
      Pakistan's 1986/87 exports at 3.6 billion dlrs, 18.2 per
  cent more than in the previous year, and imports at 5.23
  billion dlrs compared to 5.63 billion dlrs in 1985/86.
      He said the government policy was to rationalise and
  streamline import controls.
      ""It has been observed that due to restrictions on imports,
  specially on raw materials and intermediate goods, local
  industry has been suffering for want of necessary inputs,"" he
  said. ""Prices have been on the increase and quality of goods
  produced has been low. This restrictive policy also gave rise
  to smuggling and hampering of exports.""
     
      He said that to correct this situation, 136 items had freed
  from import restrictions.
      Previously, Pakistan has met its trade gap largely from
  remittances from its nationals working abroad, mainly in the
  Gulf. However, the remittances have begun to fall after the
  drop in oil prices in recent years leading to the spectre of a
  balance of payments crisis for Pakistan.

  Atlantic Richfield Co, considering a
  spin-off of a 20 pct interest in its chemical operations, could
  gain about 500 mln dlrs from the deal, industry analysts
  estimated.
      Yesterday ARCO's stock jumped as much as five points on
  rumors it was spinning off the chemical operations. Based on
  about 183 mln outstanding shares, the market in its frenzy was
  valuing the spin-off at about 900 mln dlrs, analysts said.
      Atlantic Richfield, aware of the rumors, issued a statement
  around mid-day that it was considering a sale of only 20 pct of
  the unit, leading investors to take profits.
      After the announcement, the company's stock retreated,
  closing at 93-7/8, up 1-3/8. Today it was off 1/4.
      ""It was a smaller deal than expected and somewhat
  disappointing,"" said analyst George Baker at Smith Barney. He
  said rumors of the spin-off had been around ""for a couple of
  days.""
      Baker said the unit was very profitable but it wasn't
  getting the type of exposure Atlantic Richfield sought, and its
  value was not reflected in the company's stock price.
      Industry analyst Richard Pzena of Sanford C. Bernstein said
  the unit had operating earnings of 132 mln dlrs last year and
  he expected it to earn about 175 mln dlrs this year.
      Based on a multiple of 17 times earnings--which Pzena says
  chemical companies now sell for--the entire unit is worth about
  three billion dlrs, putting the 20 pct interest at around 500
  to 600 mln dlrs.
      Pzena said he thought the company was selling the stake
  because chemical margins had peaked, and he speculated the
  company would use the proceeds to pay down debt.
      But he added the possibility remained the deal would fall
  through. Yesterday, ARCO said the proposal had not yet been
  presented to its board.

  The Senate unanimously approved

      The bill, sponsored by Senate Energy Committee chairman
  Bennett Johnston, also repeals mandatory incremental pricing of

  from major price increases by forcing some industrial users to
  pay higher than market prices.
      ""This legislation will open up new natural gas markets,"" the
  Lousiana Democrat said.
      The gas restrictions were enacted in 1978 in response to a
  shortage of natural gas and predictions of higher prices.
      ""Now both oil and gas prices are severely depressed,""

  baseload electric powerplants be designed to accomodate

test/16784,"LYNG OPENS JAPAN TALKS ON FARM TRADE BARRIERS
  U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
  opens talks with Japanese government officials today well aware
  his demand for the opening of Japanese rice, beef and citrus
  markets is likely to be rejected.
       But in an interview with Reuters during the flight to
  Tokyo yesterday, Lyng said the goal of his trip was to throw an
  international spotlight on Japan's agricultural import
  protection in the hope pressure would build on Tokyo to open
  its markets.
      ""(The Japanese) have said they are happy we are coming, but
  they are not going to give us anything,"" Lyng said.
      U.S. Officials do not expect any Japanese concessions
  during Lyng's two-week visit here. Any farm trade concessions
  would be unveiled later this month, they said.
      ""If there is anything of consequence to offer (Prime
  Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone would take it with him,"" when he
  visits Washington later in the month, one U.S. Official said.
      Lyng plans to ask Japan to open the door to rice imports by
  partially lifting the longstanding ban on foreign purchases.
      A private U.S. Rice trader visited Tokyo last week
  requesting Japan buy 200,000 tonnes of rice for industrial uses
  such as making sake. Japan has rejected the overture, saying
  Tokyo maintains a policy of self-sufficiency in rice.
      Lyng will also press Japan to eliminate an import quota for
  beef by April 1988 because he believes Japanese consumers would
  like to buy much more beef than currently allowed.
      He cited the example of a California company which
  transports live U.S. Cattle to Japan by air for slaughter to
  circumvent the beef quota. The cost of transport is higher than
  the value of the animal, he said.
      U.S. Officials said the Japan Livestock Industry Promotion
  Corporation which regulates beef imports, was forced to borrow
  from the fiscal 1987 quota earlier this year because the 1986
  quota was exhausted and Japanese beef prices were rising. Japan
  has said it cannot open its markets to beef imports.
      Along with beef, the U.S. Will also press Japan to
  eliminate import quotas on fresh oranges and orange juice by
  April, 1988. Some U.S. Officials believe Japan may eventually
  be willing to scrap the quota on fresh oranges because
  liberalized trade would not necessarily damage the Japanese
  mandarin orange industry.
      The quota on juice may be harder to eliminate because
  imports might replace domestic produced juice, U.S. And
  Japanese officials have said.
     Lyng has resurrected a past U.S. Proposal that Japan buy
  surplus U.S. Foodgrains for donation to developing countries,
  but some U.S. Officials are skeptical action will be taken.
     Lyng will also urge Japan to put its domestic farm policies,
  including rice, on the negotiating table during GATT talks in
  Geneva. He said Japan must eliminate import quotas on certain
  minor food products or face possible U.S. Reprisals.

  The Washington Post said the U.S.
  Commerce Department yesterday issued a new report showing that
  the U.S. Merchandise trade deficit was 13.65 billion dollars in
  February, a reduction of 1.4 billion dlrs from the 15.06
  billion figure the department reported only two days earlier.
      The newspaper said: ""News of the unexpectedly large 15
  billion deficit helped batter the dollar's value on foreign
  exchange markets and boosted U.S. Interest rates.
      ""However, the new report went largely unnoticed by financial
  markets since such a downward revision in the deficit is a
  monthly occurrence.""
      The Washington Post said: ""By law, the department must first
  publish what a top commerce official agreed are misleading
  trade figures and then wait 48 hours before putting out the
  more accurate ones.""
      No one was immediately available at the Commerce Department

test/17863,"BURLINGTON &lt;BUR> HEARING TO CONTINUE TOMORROW
  U.S. District Court Judge Eugene
  A. Gordon said he plans to issue a decision tomorrow on
  Burlington Industries Inc's request for an injunction to stop
  Samjens Acquisition Corp's takeover bid for the company.
      Wall Street sources have said the outcome of the case could
  be pivotal in determining the winner in the fierce takeover
  battle for Burlington, the largest u.s. textile maker.
      Gordon presided over six hours of argument today by lawyers
  for Burlington and Samjens, a partnership formed by Dominion
  Textile Inc and New York investor Asher Edelman.
      Hearings are scheduled to continue tomorrow. A preliminary
  injunction would hold up Samjens 2.47 billion dlr offer until
  the case is decided.
      Burlington had previously agreed to a 2.44 billion dlr
  buyout from Morgan Stanley Group Inc &lt;MS>, one dlr per share
  lower than a sweetened 77 dlr per share bid made by Samjens
  last week. Burlington has not responded to the new Samjens
  offer.
      Burlington has alleged in its lawsuit that Edelman and
  Dominion used illegally obtained confidential information about
  the company in making their takeover attempt.
   
      That information, Burlington said, was provided by James
  Ammeen, a former Burlington executive, through PaineWebber
  Group Inc &lt;PWJ>. Ammeen, who had worked for Burlington for 23
  years, had as many as 12 divisions with 50 pct of Burlington's
  sales reporting to him. When he left Burlington in November,
  1985, Burlington said he signed a contract promising never to
  divulge inside information about the company.
      Burlington lawyers said shortly after he left he began
  working with a PaineWebber employee on a hostile plan to
  ""takeover the company, dismember the company and displace its
  management,"" Burlington lawyer Hubert Humphrey said.
      Samjens lawyers acknowledged it received information from
  PaineWebber, but argued the information was public information
  and could be obtained either from texitle industry analysts or
  Burlington's public financial statements.
      Burlington lawyers said PaineWebber and Ammeen met with
  Edelman and Dominion in November and continued to meet with
  them until a couple of days before Edelman and Dominion went
  public April 24 with their intention to take over the company.
  Burlington lawyers claim Dominion's board decided to attempt a
  takeover of Burlington after Ammeen met with the board in
  February.
      Burlington lawyers said Edelman and Dominion held
  discussions with PaineWebber and Ammeen about acting as
  financial advisers to Samjens. But they allege talks broke off
  because Painewebber and Ammeen could not satisfy Edelman and
  dominion with a written statement that they did not provide
  inside information.
      Lawyers for Samjens contended that Painewebber and Ammeen
  withdrew as potential advisers because Burlington chairman
  Frank Greenberg had called a PaineWebber executive and
  threatened legal action if PaineWebber got involved in an
  effort to takeover Burlilgnton.
      ""The ultimate question is not the price per share or the
  profit, but rather the permissable standards of conduct for
  those who would takeover an American company,"" said burlington
  lawyer Humphrey.
      Burlington lawyers also contended that Burlington, as the
  largest manufacturer of denim in the United States, would be in
  violation of anti-trust laws if it acquired Dominion, Canada's
  largest textile maker. Dominion has denim manufacturing plants
  in Georgia, which would reduce competition in the denim market,
  the lawyers said.
      Samjens' lawyers discounted the concern. They said the
  market for denim is more fragmented than Burlington contends
  and that Burlington has the ability to switch between light
  weight and heavy weight denim production as demand and price
  dictate.
      Samjens lawyers also pointed to a lawsuit filed by
  Burlington in Canada, in which it said it was considering a bid
  for Dominion. ""Surely, what would have been sauce for the goose
  would have been sauce for the gander,"" said Sidney Rosdeitcher,
  a Samjens lawyer.

  U.S. corn sales of just over 1.0 mln

  Agriculture Department said.
      In comments on its latest Export Sales Report, the
  department said Iraq, Japan and the USSR were the largest
  buyers.
      Sales for the next marketing year, which begins September
  1, totaled 503,200 tonnes and were mainly to Iraq and Taiwan.
      Wheat sales of 119,300 tonnes for the current season and
  net reductions of 13,700 tonnes for the 1987/88 season were
  four-fifths below the combined total for the prior week and the
  four-week average, it said.
      Sri Lanka was the most active wheat destination with
  purchases of 52,500 tonnes for the current year, it said.
      Other significant purchasers for the current year were
  Mexico and Honduras, it said.
      Soybean sales of 240,500 tonnes were one-fifth below the
  prior week and nearly one-third below the four-week average.
      Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Italy and Israel were the major
  purchasers, the department said.
      Net sales of 117,700 tonnes of soybean cake and meal fell
  31 pct from the previous week and 38 pct below the four-week
  average. Major increases for West Germany, Venezuela, the
  Netherlands and Saudi Arabia were partially offset by
  reductions for unknown destinations, USDA said.
      Activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of 2,400
  tonnes, with sales to unknown destinations down by 2,700
  tonnes, while sales to Canada increased 200 tonnes, the
  Department said.
      Combined sales of 71,300 running bales of cotton -- 60,200
  bales for the current season and 11,100 bales for 1987/88
  season -- were four-fifths higher than the prior week's level
  but nine pct below the four-week average.
      Mexico was the dominant buyer for the current year followed

  A prolonged dry spell has damaged
  111,350 hectares of rice and corn plantations in 10 provinces
  in the central and southern Philippines, agriculture officials
  said.
      They said some 71,070 tonnes of agricultural produce
  estimated at about 250 mln pesos was lost to the lack of
  rainfall. They warned of a severe drought if the prevailing
  conditions continued until next month.
      Agriculture Secretary Carlos Dominguez said he hoped the
  losses would be offset by the expected increase in output in
  other, normally more productive areas not affected by the dry
  spell.
      Affected were 14,030 hectares of palay (unmilled rice),
  representing a production loss of 22,250 tonnes valued at 77.8
  mln pesos, Department of Agriculture reports said.
      About 48,820 tonnes of corn from 97,320 hectares valued at
  170.8 mln pesos have also been lost, they said.
      Officials said the hectarage planted to palay that has been
  hit by the drought accounted for only one pct of national total
  thus the damage is considered negligible.
      In the case of corn, they said the loss can be filled by
  production from non-traditional corn farms which diversified
  into the cash crop from sugar two years ago.
       The Philippine Coconut Authority said coconut production
  in the major producing region of Bicol might drop by 25 pct to
  320,000 tonnes if the dry spell continued. There were no
  reports of actual damage.

  India's national foodgrain target has
  been fixed at 160 mln tonnes in 1987/88 (Apr-Mar), unchanged
  from the 1986/87 target, the Agriculture Ministry said in its
  annual report for 1986/87.
      Actual output was estimated at 151 mln tonnes in 1986/87
  due to failure of monsoon rains in 15 out of 35 meterological
  sub-divisions of the country.
      The report gave the targets for various crops with
  estimated harvested crops in 1986/87 in brackets as following,
  in mln tonnes - rice 65 (60), wheat 49 (49), coarse grains
  including sorghum and millets 32 (29) and pulses 14 (13).
      Despite failure of monsoon rains in recent years, it was
  possible to maintain higher foodgrain production, signifying
  growing resilience in agricultural sector, the report said.
      The strategy for increasing irrigation potential along with
  greater use of high yielding seed varieites and improvement in
  fertiliser efficiency is yielding results, it said, adding
  total foodgrain output in 1985/86, 1984/85 and 1983/84
  respectively was 150.5 mln tonnes, 145.5 mln and a record 152.4
  mln.
     India has targeted to produce between 178 and 183 mln tonnes
  of foodgrains by the last year of the seventh five-year
  development plan ending March 31, 1990.
      Taking the midpoint of 180 mln tonnes as the target and the
  1986/87 estimated production of around 151 mln tonnes, the gap
  of 29 mln tonnes has to be made up during the remaining three
  years of the plan by increasing grain output annually by more
  than nine mln tonnes. But the target can be achieved only with
  good weather, the report said.
      ""The major thrust programme will, therefore, be better water
  (irrigation) management. Simultaneously, efforts for spread of
  improved technology including timely use of inputs (farm
  materials like fertilisers) in adequate quantities have to be
  vigrously pursued,"" it said.

test/19828,"SAN FRANCISCO, NOT REGION, HURT BY RESTRUCTURING
  Corporate mergers and acquisitions
  in and around San Francisco over the past seven years have had
  only a modest effect on the metropolitan area's economy, a
  leading business-backed organization said.
      The Bay Area Council, a group of more than 300 business
  firms, said that a study of corporate restructuring in a
  nine-county area found that San Francisco itself had suffered
  some ill effects from corporate shake-ups but that surrounding
  communities had not.
      Seventeen of the 32 Fortune 500 companies in the area left
  due to corporate restructuring between 1979 and 1986, but
  another 21 firms were added to the list.
      Ten of the departing companies were based in San Francisco.
  During the period, only six located in the city achieved
  Fortune 500 status.
      Ted Hall, a council director and local managing director of
  McKinsey and Co. which conducted the survey, said the study
  grew out of concern that mergers and acquisitions had seriously
  hurt the economic climate of northern California.
      However, Hall said that only about 36,000 jobs had been
  lost in the region, while more than 600,000 new jobs were
  created during the period.
      At the same time, he said, the region experienced a greater
  rise in per capita income and lower unemployment than the rest
  of the United States and California.
      Council President George Keller, who also is chairman and
  chief executive officer of Chevron Corp., told a news
  conference that the region had difficulties in persuading
  companies to locate there because of a fragmented local
  political system.
      But he said that because of the amenities of living in San
  Francisco, he was the envy of many chief executives in other
  metropolitan area.
      ""It's a great place to run a business,"" he added, ""but it's
  a hell of a place to do business with government.""
      The study concluded that Chevron, which mergered with Gulf
  Oil in 1984, would benefit in the long run from the
  restructuring activity.
      Among the corporate headquarters lost during the period
  were Crown Zellerbach, Memorex, Southern Pacific, Castle &amp;
  Cooke and Rolm.
      Companies that grew enough during the period to make the
  Fortune 500 list included Apple Computer, Pacific Telesis,
  McKesson, Tandem Computer, U.S. Leasing and Amfac.
      The study by the management consulting firm said that,
  partly due to corporate restructuring, the rate of job growth
  in San Francisco has slowed since 1980.
      In addition, it said that the loss of corporate leadership
  had adversely affected some of the Bay Area's civic and
  charitable activities.

test/20744,"BANK OF NEW YORK REAFFIRMS TERMS FOR IRVING &lt;V>
  The Bank of New York Corp &lt;BK> said it
  reaffirmed the terms of its offer for Irving Bank Corp despite
  the drop in the Bank of New York's share price to 30-1/8, a
  Bank of New York spokesman said.
      ""The offer still stands, we have not changed our offer,"" a
  Bank of New York spokesman said.
      Irving would not comment on how the drop in the market
  affects its position on the bid or whether it would buy back
  any of its own shares.
      Earlier this month, Irving rejected the bid as inadequate
  and said it wanted to retain its independence.
      In late September, Bank of New York offered 80 dlrs per
  share in cash for 47.4 pct of Irving. For the remaining 52.6
  pct, it offered an exchange of 1.9 shares of its shares for one
  Irving share.
      At that time, the stock purchase portion was worth close to
  80 dlrs per share, but now that portion is worth 53 dlrs per
  share for a net price of 68 dlrs, one analyst said.
      According to the prospectus offer, shareholders may tender
  for all cash or all shares on a first come, first serve basis.
      Analysts were mixed about how the stock price drop would
  affect the acquisition.
      ""If it gets to the Irving shareholders, they would approve
  it, but Irving hopes the offer won't go to the shareholders,""
  said Mark Alpert, banking analyst with Bear Stearns Cos Inc.
      ""And the market is saying the deal won't go through,""
  Alpert said.
      ""The transaction looks highly unlikely to be completed at
  present. If Irving wouldn't go with the offer at 80 dlrs a
  share, then they won't go at a lower price,"" another analyst
  said.
      The analyst also doubted that Bank of New York could afford
  to retain its original offer.
      However, industry sources were more uncertain about
  prospects for the deal.
      ""With Irving's price so low, Bank of New York's offer will
  look good to Irving shareholders,"" said Michael Flores, a
  consultant at Bank Earnings International, a consulting firm.
      The drop of Irving's share to 44 dlrs per share, which is
  about a 26 dlr drop from the beginning of last week, increases
  the chance that Bank of New York will succeed, Flores said.
      Analysts said that the drop in bank stock prices is likely
  to depress the level of mergers and acquisition in the banking
  industry.
      ""Bank takeovers are less likely because banks can't use
  their own stock to make acquisitions because their share price
  is too depressed,"" Alpert said.
      Since only banks can buy another bank, the only other
  possible acquirors would be a foreign bank, Alpert said.
      ""In the market drop the stock of acquirors got clobbered
  more than the acquirees,"" another analyst said.

  Treasury Secretary James Baker said
  the floating exchange rate system has not been as effective as
  had been hoped in promoting stability and preventing imbalances
  from emerging in the global economy.
      In remarks before the afternoon session of the
  International Monetary Fund's Interim Committee, Baker said he
  was not suggesting that the system should be abandoned.
      ""But I do suggest,"" he said, ""that we need something to give
  it more stability and to keep it headed in the right direction
  when the wind shifts.""
      He said that indicators can serve ""as a kind of compass"" but
  added that structural indicators can help focus attention on
  some policies.
      Baker, however, said the IMF ""needs to move beyond
  macroeconomic indicators and find structural indicators that
  can help focus attention on some of the policies of specific
  relevance to the imbalances we face today.""
      The Treasury Secretary said that indicators should be given
  a more prominent role in the annual economic reviews -- Article
  IV consultations -- that the Fund performs.
      Baker also told the policy making group that it was time
  for the IMF to adopt earlier recommendations making IMF
  surveillance more relevant to national policymakers and the
  public.
      ""In particular, we urge increased publicity for IMF
  appraisals developed in Article IV consultations, the use of
  follow-up reports on country actions to implement IMF
  recommendations, and greater use of special consultation
  procedures,"" he said.
      Baker emphasized that indicators were a device ""for moving
  beyond rhetoric to action.""
      He said they provide ""more structure to the system, and
  induce more discipline and peer pressure into the process of
  policy coordination.""
      He said the Fund's procedures for surveillance need to be
  reviewed and updated to reflect the use of indicators.
      ""This should be matter of priority for the executive board,""
  he said.
      Baker also urged the Fund to develop alternative
  medium-term economic scenarios for countries that ""can help us
  focus even more clearly on the most important imbalances, by
  identifying options for addressing them and analyzing the
  implications of these options.""
      He said also that further work should be done on finding
  paths that lead toward possible medium-term objectives.
      ""If we are to take effective remedial action when there are
  significant deviations from an intended course, then we must
  have more definitive ways of indentifying the right course for
  key variables,"" he said.

  American Brands Inc's 545 mln dlrs

       ""They were very frustrated with their inability to get

  doesn't surprise me that they came up with another one,"" said
  Allan Kaplan of Merrill Lynch and Co.
      American Brands failed late last year in its 2.9 billion
  dlrs bid for Chesebrough-Ponds Inc when Unilever N.V. agreed to
  buy the company. But since then, Wall Street has been
  speculating that American Brands would find another candidate
  to help reduce its earnings exposure to tobacco.
      ""This is just typical,"" said George Thompson of
  Prudential-Bache securities. ""There's going to be more to come
  here. American Brands had to make an acquisition because
  tobacco is still a significant part of earnings. Their position
  is a little less favorable than Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds,""

  does require great amounts of capital expenditures. It can
  therefore use its funds to make acquisitions. Analysts said the
  National Distillers' spirits company, which makes Gilbey's gin
  and vodka, Old Grandad and Old Crow whiskey, is not quite the
  type of acquisition they envisioned.
      ""The distilled spirits business has been in a steady
  gradual decline for sometime, as has the tobacco business,""

  Dufour told Reuters in response to a query.
      ""All the information that has been given out publicly is

  U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition.

  U.S. textile companies but would not say whether Burlington
  Industries was one of them.
      Burlington's stock rose sharply this morning on the report,

  Japanese compound feed output rose 2.3 pct
  to 25.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87 ended March 31 from 25.23 mln a
  year earlier, the Agriculture Ministry said.
      The marginal rise reflected slight growth in demand for
  poultry raising and a moderate increase in demand for beef
  cattle raising, Ministry officials said.
      Compound feed sales totalled 26.01 mln tonnes in 1986/87
  against 25.40 mln a year ago, while end-March stocks were
  217,554 tonnes against 224,101.
      Corn use in feed output in 1986/87 rose to 11.71 mln tonnes
  from 11.02 mln a year earlier due to low import prices.
      The officials said corn imports rose because the world
  surplus and the yen's strength against the dollar reduced
  Chicago prices. The corn compounding ratio rose to 45.2 pct in
  1986/87 from 43.4 pct a year earlier.
      Sorghum use rose marginally to 4.80 mln tonnes in 1986/87
  from 4.79 mln, but the compounding ratio fell to 18.5 pct from
  18.9 pct because of greater corn use. Higher import prices due
  to poor harvests last year in major producing nations such as
  Argentina made feed makers reluctant to use sorghum.
      Soybean meal use fell to 2.58 mln tonnes from 2.63 mln and
  the compounding ratio declined to 10.0 pct from 10.3 pct.
      The drop in soybean meal consumption resulted from
  increased use of cheaper rapeseed meal, the officials said.
      Rapeseed consumption in 1986/87 was 563,889 tonnes against
  528,152 a year earlier. The compounding ratio rose to 2.2 pct
  from 2.1 pct.

  Ecuador will resume limited crude output
  next week to fill up storage tanks as a first step to pump oil
  to a Colombian pipeline on May one, the state Ecuadorean
  Petroleum Corp (CEPE) said.
      CEPE manager Carlos Romoleroux told reporters that Ecuador
  would begin pumping an unspecified amount of crude in
  northeastern jungle oilfields at the end of next week in
  preparation to send the oil through a new pipeline link-up to
  neighbouring Colombia.
      Oil production in Ecuador was halted on March five when an
  earthquake damaged the country's main pipeline from Lago Agrio,
  at the heart of the Ecuadorean jungle oilfields, to the pacific
  port of Balao.
      It will take at least until the end of July to repair the
  pipeline and return output to normal levels. The country was
  pumping between 245,000 bpd and 250,000 bpd before the tremor.
      To resume limited output in the meantime, Ecuador is
  constructing a 26 mile pipeline linkup, capable of carrying
  55,000 bpd, from Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon, the starting point
  of Colombia's pipeline to the Pacific port of Tumaco.
      The original target date to resume limited crude output was
  May eight, the scheduled date for the inauguration of the Lago
  Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline, an energy ministry spokesman
  said.

      The 100 pct tariffs are to be imposed on 300 mln dlrs of
  Japanese goods recommended for curbs by a special panel of
  experts headed by the U.S. Trade Representative's Office.
      Reagan announced last March 27 he would impose the tariffs
  on certain goods taken from a list that ranged from computors
  and television sets to power tools and photographic film.
      The panel this week winnowed through the list of the some
  20 products and sent their recommendations yesterday to Santa
  Barbara, where Reagan is vacationing.
      In his March annoucement, Reagan said ""I am committed to
  full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide
  American industry with free and fair trade opportunities.""
      He added the tariffs would be lifted once Japan honored the
  pact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in world
  markets and opened its home market to U.S. products.
      U.S. officials said Japan had done nothing since the March
  announcement to alter Reagan's plan to invoke the sanctions.
      White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday:  ""we
  do not want a trade war, but we feel that this is the kind of
  action that requires meaningful action.""
      Reagan's move follows steadily rising U.S. trade deicits,
  with last year's hitting a record $169.8 billion.
      About one-third of the deficit is in trade with Japan.
      Congress is weighing a trade bill to force the president to
  retaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices.
      He has opposed the legislation, saying it would prevent
  negotiated solutions to trade disputes and, in any case, that
  existing law was adqeuate to end unfair trade practices.
      Trade experts say his tough action against the Japanese was
  as much to penalize the Japanese as to show Congress he did not
  need any new trade legislation.
      The Japanese have complained that they have been honoring
  the semiconductor pact, but that it would take time before the
  results showed up.
      U.S. officials, however, have said their monitoring of
  Japanese semiconductor shipments to East Asian countries and
  Western Europe showed no letup in the dumping and that the
  Japanese home markets remained shut to American exports.
      Japan has said that if Reagan imposed the tariffs, it would
  file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade
  (GATT).
      It said hoped GATT would find the U.S. retaliation had
  violated the regulations of the global trading group and would
  approve compensation or Japanese retaliation.
      U.S. officials have said they did not think Japan would
  retaliate because it had too much to lose in any trade war with
  the United States.

test/20511,"EC AGREES TRADE DEAL WITH ARGENTINA
  The European Community (EC) agreed a
  trade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the country
  following the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group, EC
  officials said.
      Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers, Argentina
  will gain additional trading rights on a series of products
  including meat, fish and cereals by-products.
      But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with
  Canada and Japan and are due to study these again, the
  officials said.
      The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC
  states after West Germany withdrew objections to increased
  quotas for Argentina on high-quality beef.
      Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat,
  saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals
  substitutes, but they were outvoted by the other states, the
  officials said. Under the deal, Argentina will benefit from
  improved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular the
  quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4,500
  tonnes to 34,300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will
  be increased by 3,000 tonnes to 53,000 tonnes.
      Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of
  5,000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced
  levies on 550,000 tonnes of wheat bran, the officials said.
      The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said
  that Spain and Portugal's entry into the EC affected their
  exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. They
  have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement
  on Tariffs and Trade).
      But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve
  Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had
  been affected by the country's EC membership.
      Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the
  fish dispute with Canada.
      Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan. The EC
  claims that Spain and Portugal's entry into the group has
  improved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied
  with Japanese offers of compensation.
      Japan's main offers were to improve inspection systems on
  citrus fruits to aid EC exports, to improve tariffs for some
  other farm produce, to increase tariffs for leather footwear
  and to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal.
      EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq told
  journalists: ""We maintain our position that the (Japanese)
  concessions were not enough.""
      ""We hope that there will be an improvement,"" he said.

      ""In order to boost investment in the petroleum industry, the
  government of Indonesia has basically approved of extending
  production sharing contracts under the present laws,"" Suharto
  said.
      ""Apart from that, the government will keep improving the
  investment climate in order to accelerate the development of
  the petroleum industry,"" he said.
      Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto told the Association he
  was aware that the oil industry needed to be assured that
  contracts on blocks expiring within the next 10 years would be
  renewed before they would invest in further exploration.
      ""As we all have heard this morning, the President is fully
  aware of this situation,"" Subroto said.
      ""The government has already made the political decision to
  entertain this time problem by inviting the existing producers
  to continue their activities in Indonesia, albeit on a
  selective basis.""
      Indonesia, one of the 13 members of OPEC, must find new oil
  reserves if it is to remain an exporter in the next decade, oil
  industry sources say.
      Subroto said the government was also working to ease other
  problems, including granting easier terms for remote areas or
  deep water conditions.
      But Subroto said relations with oil companies were two-way
  and that they should step up expenditure on oil exploration now
  that the oil price had recovered.
      President Suharto said he wanted to see greater transfer of
  technology to Indonesian companies, and more help from the oil
  industry for the regions in which companies operated.
      Abdul Rachman Ramly, the President of state oil company
  Pertamina, has said that budgeted exploration and production
  expenditure for all oil companies in Indonesia was forecast to
  fall to 3.1 billion dlrs in calendar 1987 from 3.4 billion in
  1986.
      Pertamina has 69 production-sharing or joint operation
  contracts with foreign oil companies.
      Subroto said speeding up necessary approvals for field
  operations was a government priority. There had been
  misunderstandings between the government and the oil industry
  in certain areas, such as when a field is designated
  commercial, and a thorough evaluation was being made.
      He said the government wanted to finalise contract
  extensions as soon as practical, and urged the industry in the
  meantime to maintain its exploration drive.
      Subroto said Indonesia needed the companies to maintain
  exploration efforts, even if their contract was due to expire
  within 10 years. ""This need in itself is some sort of guarantee
  that we will soon have to come up with an extension agreement.""
      Eleven major contract areas are due to come up for renewal
  between 1991 and 2001, industry sources said.
      Extension of the contracts on the blocks has involved
  detailed negotiations but so far no extension has been granted.
      Subroto told reporters afterwards that contract extensions
  would be selective, based on how much capital would be
  invested.

  Overseas Shipholding Group Inc president
  Morton Hyman said if oil production by OPEC rises during the
  second half of 1987, freight rates for tankers should rise
  accordingly.
      Hyman, delivering a speech at the annual shareholders
  meeting, said international tanker markets were generally weak
  throughout the first quarter, but since the end of March OPEC
  oil production has picked up. The result has been a modest
  improvement in tanker rates.
      Overseas said 73 pct of its fleet handles liquid cargo.
     
      He said tanker requirements decreased in September 1986 as
  OPEC production quotas dropped and levels of oil stocks rose.
      For the first quarter 1987, the company reported net income
  of 10.3 mln dlrs, or 40 cts per share, compared to 9.3 mln
  dlrs, or 36 cts per share, for the comparable quarter a year
  ago.
      The company reported net income for 1986 of 37.3 mln dlrs,
  or 1.45 dlrs per share.
     
      ""The improvement in the company's 1986 results, after four
  years of declining earnings, reflects a sharp, albeit
  temporary, rise in freight rates in the international tanker
  markets last summer,"" Hyman said.
      He said the Alaskan oil trade continues to be the principal
  source of employment for its U.S. flag tanker fleet, which
  represents approximately 15 pct of the company's tonnage.
      Overseas owns and operates 67 vessels.

  The tough trade sanctions President
  Reagan imposed on Japanese exports are not only a shot across
  Japan's bow but also a sign Reagan will attack unfair trade
  practices worldwide, U.S. officials said.
      But Robert Crandall, a trade specialist at Brookings
  Institution, a think tank, said ""a shot across their bow can
  often result in a shot in our stern.""
      He said it left the United States open to retaliation.
      The U.S. officials said the 100 pct tariffs Reagan ordered
  on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods will also show Congress
  that a tough pro-trade stand can be taken under existing laws,
  and no new protectionist legislation is needed.
      In the past year tough trade action had been taken against
  the European Community over corn and sorghum, Taiwan over beer
  and wine, South Korea over counterfeiting of copyrights,
  patents and trademarkets and Japan on tobacco.
      White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters the
  tariffs - up from five pct - should be seen as a ""serious signal""
  to other nations on the need for fair trade practices.
      Reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers,
  television sets and some hand tools because Japan did not honor
  an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at
  less than cost and to open its markets to U.S. products. The
  tariffs were placed on items which were available from other
  sources so there would be little effect on the American
  consumer, Fitzwater said.
      Reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action
  - especially against Japan - to end global unfair trade
  practices and reverse the growing U.S. trade deficit.
      The alternative was that if he did not, Congress would.
      The U.S. trade gap last year was a record 169.8 billion
  dlrs, and continues to rise, with Japan accounting for about
  one-third of America's overall deficit.
      But there are other two-way deficits - with Canada, West
  Germany, Taiwan and South Korea - and Reagan officials said the
  president is ready to fight them all.
      Reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that ""I regret
  that these actions are necessary,"" but that the health and
  vitality of the U.S. semiconductor industry was essential to
  American competitiveness in world markets.
      ""We cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading
  practices,"" Reagan added in the statement from his California
  vacation home at Santa Barbara.
      He said the tariffs would remain in force until Japan
  abided by the agreement.
      U.S. officials say the action today will show Congress -
  which is about to write a trade bill he does not like - that he
  already has the tools needed to fight unfair trade.
      The White House aide said of the tariff action, ""it wasn't
  done to appease Congress, but because there was an unfair trade
  practice.""
      The aide added, however, ""on another plane, it was an
  example of how the administration uses the trade law to fight
  unfair practices, an that it is not necessary to make a major
  overall of our trade laws.""
      But the analyst, Crandall, said the tariff action was not
  in the best interests of the United States, and that
  negotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue.
      ""It's very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route,"" he
  said, ""because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in
  trade.""
      Crandall said, ""the administration is doing this for its
  political impact across the country, and therefore its impact
  on Congress.""
      He said, ""I don't think it makes a lot of sense.""
      But other analysts said it made little difference whether
  the tariffs were aimed at U.S. trading partners or Congress,
  and that the main point was that the trading partners were on
  notice that retaliation was a weapon Reagan was ready to use.
      Spokesman Fitzwater said ""we don't want a trade war,"" but the
  imposition of sanctions showed the United States would act when
  it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated.

  A North Sea oil find announced by Chevron
  Corp's &lt;CHV> Chevron Exploration North Sea Ltd may indicate a
  new field with recoverable crude oil reserves of 300 mln
  barrels, industry analysts said.
      Chevron said a sidetrack well on block 16/26 on the U.K.
  Continental shelf tested 9,000 barrels per day (bpd) of 20 API
  crude oil from the tertiary ""Alba"" sand through a three-inch
  surface choke.
      ""The estimated amount of oil at the Alba field is around 320
  mln barrels,"" Paul Spedding of stockbroker Kleinwort Grieveson
  and Co told Reuters.
      He said industry estimates put the total reserves at the
  field at over one billion barrels, but given the low gravity of
  oil, the recovery rate would be expected to be around 20-25
  pct.
      Analysts said the results were encouraging, but the
  potential difficulty of operating and recovering oil in the
  field was shown by the fact that the first well had to be
  plugged and a sidetrack drilled.
      ""The field seems to be shallow and widespread, which will
  require a multi-platform development in recovery, pushing costs
  up,"" Christopher Osborne of stockbroker Hoare Govett said.
      Most analysts said that although the low gravity of the oil
  found would require additional costs in recovery, the test well
  showed that it flows well.
      ""Although the gravity of oil at the field seems to be low,
  it seems to flow quite well and around 300 mln barrels could be

  heavy crude it produced.

  the price differentials between heavy and light crudes are a

  Senior Japanese officials tomorrow
  open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch
  effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide
  variety of Japanese electronic exports.
      Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japan's Ministry of
  International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of
  meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael
  Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart.
      The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in
  retaliation for Japan's failure to adhere to an agreement to
  end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and
  to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments.
      They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors,
  including television and audio equipment and computers.
      Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little
  likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct
  duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments.
      President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27
  after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986
  U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that
  Japan was not honoring the agreement.
      In making the annoucement, Reagan said ""I am committed to
  the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to
  provide American industry with free and fair trade.""
      Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japan's
  semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured
  the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has
  complained about presidential timidity on trade issues.
      Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive
  trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagan's
  inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last
  year reached 169.8 billion dlrs.
      About one-third of the deficit was with Japan.
      Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to
  adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it.
      Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals
  but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation.
      He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagan's
  decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense
  of MITI's power to control Japanese traders.
      ""The United States has excessive expectations.,"" he said. To
  stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by
  excess inventories since 1985 will take some time.""
      He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough
  in trying to sell in the Japanese market.

  A new convoy of tankers escorted by
  American warships headed down the Gulf on Wednesday, towards
  Iranian oil platforms still oozing smoke after having being
  blasted by U.S. Navy raiders.
      Some Gulf sea captains were reported to be steering well
  clear of Iran's Silkworm missiles, however, and frontline
  emirate Kuwait redeployed air defences to counter the threat.

      Shipping sources said on Tuesday night at least six sea
  captains had voiced fears that Iran would avenge Monday's U.S.
  Raids by unleashing more Silkworm missiles at ships plying the
  Gulf.
      Belgium decided two minesweepers en route for the Gulf
  would stay out for the time being following Monday's U.S.

      But there was no sign that the prospect of more tit-for-tat
  assaults had reduced the level of shipping activity in the

      Iran, having vowed to react strongly after Monday's U.S.
  Action, launched a barrage of threats and ridicule.
      For its part, Washington warned Iran again on Tuesday that
  it was ready for any further hostile action.
      Pentagon officials then announced that a U.S. Guided
  missile destroyer began escorting two Kuwaiti tankers flying
  the U.S. flag southwards--the 80,000 tonne product carrier
  Ocean City and 46,000 tonne petroleum tanker Gas King.

  Remarks by two leading central bankers
  sparked renewed speculation in financial markets that a cut in
  the West German three pct discount rate may be under
  discussion, currency dealers said.
      Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler said in a speech that
  monetary growth resulting from speculative capital inflows
  required cuts in interest rates.
      Separately, West Berlin state central bank president Dieter
  Hiss told journalists that the discount rate could fall below
  its lowest ever point of 2.75 pct. He made clear that he was
  not making a forecast on interest rates, however.
      Currency dealers here and in the Far East said the dollar
  gained slight background support from the speculation.
      But German dealers noted that the Bundesbank kept the 3.80
  pct rate unchanged at which it offered liquidity to the money
  market this week, dashing some expectations that it may either
  offer lower fixed rate money or offer a reduced minimum rate
  and let the strength of banks' demands set the allocation rate.
      It allocated 6.1 billion marks in new liquidity, much less
  than the 14.9 billion leaving the market as a prior pact
  expired. This further weakened sentiment the Bundesbank could
  move to a more accommodative monetary stance, dealers said.
      Koehler said in a speech in Surrey, England, speculative
  capital inflows may cause monetary growth, regardless of
  whether central banks intervened or exchange rates fell.
      ""In other words, the monetary policy measures required are
  different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --
  those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of
  mounting economic activity.""
      Though Koehler was known to be the most liberal of the
  generally monetarist Bundesbank board, his comments marked the
  first time cuts in rates had been concretely suggested as a

      Comsat, created by a 1962 act of Congress, and Contel, a

  application for merger. Several firms had protested the

  Lebanon's Bankers Association said it
  extended its suspension of trading in the Lebanese pound for
  two more working days to study ways to stem the currency's
  collapse.
      The Central Bank did not post the rate of the pound to the
  dollar and other currencies on Monday. The pound closed on
  Thursday at 407.00/412.00 to the dollar compared with
  Wednesday's close of 384.00/386.00.
      Association sources told Reuters Friday's suspension of
  trading for two working days was continued on Monday for two
  more days so as to study proposals to reinforce the pound.
      The Association, which comprises 106 commercial banks in
  east and west Beirut, halted trading on Friday in a chaotic
  market after the pound crashed to four record lows in the week.
      The pound, hit by the inability of Lebanon's religiously
  and ideologically divided government to end 12 years of civil
  war, has lost more than 80 pct of its international value this
  year.

  indicative of that,"" commented economist James Donegan at the
  Toronto securities firm of Midland Doherty Ltd.
      Statistics Canada reported the surplus was driven by a 23
  pct gain in automobile product exports to a record 3.2 billion
  dls in the month.
      ""Recovery in the automotive sector helped push the value of
  exports up by 5.9 pct in February,"" the agency said in its
  monthly report.
      Total exports expanded to 10.44 billion dlrs from 9.85
  billion dlrs in February, while imports slipped to 9.19 billion
  dlrs from 9.23 billion dlrs.
      Economists have predicted the 1987 trade surplus would end
  up three to five billion dlrs higher than last year's dismal
  10.1 billion dlr total. In 1985 the surplus was 17.48 billion
  dlrs.
      Money market analysts said the positive trade news touched
  off a modest rally in the Canadian dollar, which rose to 76.85
  U.S. cts on North American markets early this morning after
  closing at 76.58 cts Wednesday.
      The currency was hovering around 76.78 cts in early
  afternoon trading.
      Economists have been banking on an improved trade
  performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish

      Economists have been banking on an improved trade
  performance this year to stimulate an otherwise sluggish
  Canadian economy.
      They say the country's consumers, who have been spending at
  a torrid pace in recent years, will sharply curtail outlays
  this year and this should help curtail the flow of imports into
  the country.
      Meanwhile, demand for Canadian exports in the United
  States, by far the country's largest market, is expected to be
  strong as a result of a projected rise in American consumer
  spending and the relatively low value of the Canadian currency.
      ""We maintain what's going to drive Canada's export
  performance is income growth in the U.S.,"" said Midland's
  Donegan.
      But at the Bank of Nova Scotia, deputy chief economist
  Warren Jestin was less optimistic about the U.S. outlook and
  said it could be a mistake to read too much into February's
  trade upturn.
      Jestin said, ""Given the fact the U.S. economy is showing
  signs of weakening--particularly car sales--it would indicate
  that part of the strength (in Canada's trade figures) is
  probably transitory.""

  A takeover battle began today for
  debt-burdened Dome Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> as TransCanada
  PipeLines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO> announced a 4.3 billion dlr offer and
  Dome said it is continuing talks with other possible buyers.
      Companies mentioned in market speculation as potential
  buyers for Dome include Imperial Oil Ltd &lt;IMO.A> which is 70
  pct owned by Exxon Corp &lt;XON.N>, &lt;PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd>
  which is 87 pct owned by the conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd
  &lt;CP.N> and British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L>.
      Along with the TransCanada offer, Dome has had another
  proposal from ""a substantial company"" and discussions with a
  third company which could lead to an offer, Dome said in a
  statement.
      The statement confirmed Dome received TransCanada's bid,
  but did not identify the companies involved in talks.
      TransCanada, Canada's largest natural gas pipeline
  operator, said it is offering Dome a package of cash, common
  and preferred shares, and shares in a new subsidiary which
  would own and operate Dome's assets. TransCanada said the offer
  is to Dome management, not to shareholders.
      Dome has massive oil and gas landholdings in Canada,
  totalling 36.1 mln acres of which 7.4 mln have been developed.
  It also has tax credits worth about 2.5 billion dlrs.
      Dome's statement said the TransCanada announcement ""violated
  the terms and spirit of a confidentiality agreement entered
  into with prospective purchasers"" and was apparently timed to
  prevent Dome from considering other proposals.
      It said the TransCanada bid ""seems to require favourable and
  substantial taxation concessions from the federal and
  provincial governments."" But Dome added that its management and
  financial advisers will evaluate all proposals.
      TransCanada chief financial officer H. Neil Nichols said he
  was surprised at the vehemence of Dome's statement and denied
  that TransCanada was trying to usurp other bids. ""I find (Dome's
  statement) very bothersome. Once the board made the decision to
  authorise the proposal, it had a legal obligation to announce
  it,"" he said. Nichols said he did not know the identity of the
  other bidders, or the terms of other offers.
      Dome common shares closed at 1.13 dlrs on Friday on the
  Toronto Stock Exchange. The preferred class A stock closed at
  5.00 dlrs. Common stock traded as high as 25.00 dlrs in 1981.

  A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome
  Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO>
  may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the door
  for more takeover bids, oil analysts said.
      Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt
  of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim
  debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer
  substantial payments to creditors will expire.
      Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders
  that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan.
      Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as
  public noteholders in March after several months of delicate
  negotiations.
      TransCanada's proposal ""amounts to a quasi debt
  restructuring,"" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker
  Ltd said from Toronto.
      Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow
  creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet
  to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to
  cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.
      ""The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that
  even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that
  Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,""
  said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in
  Calgary.
      TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome
  was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed
  refinancing packages, Gobert said.
      The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome
  since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders
  to agree to a restructuring, he added.
      ""I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain
  any and all offers (for Dome),"" Gobert said.
      Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that
  TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix
  the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other
  possible buyers from making an offer. ""By drawing attention to
  us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little
  reluctant to come forward,"" he said.
      Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal
  offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a
  confidential agreement between the two companies, he said.
      Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions
  with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other
  unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and
  financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including
  TransCanada's.
      Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price
  for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.
      However, he said not enough financial details are known
  about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of
  TransCanada's proposed offer.

  Hawkeye Bancorp's 1986 annual

  the annual report.
      ""...there are conditions which may indicate that the
  company will be unable to continue as a going concern,""
  auditors Deloitte Haskins and Sells said in Hawkeye's annual
  report to shareholders.
      Hawkeye reported a 1986 loss of almost 59 mln dlrs, citing
  an increase in its loan loss provision to 34.7 mln dlrs and
  restructuring costs of 27 mln dlrs.
      However, Hawkeye, with assets of 1.09 billion dlrs at 1986
  year end, said it expects ""to have sufficient cash to meet its
  obligations for the next 12-month period.""
      Last July the bank holding company reached a debt
  restructuring agreement which identifed 17 bank subsidiaries
  and five non-bank operations for disposition.
      ""The restructuring has improved Hawkeye's financial
  condition, but it does not assure that Hawkeye will be able to
  survive as a going concern,"" the report said.
      Hawkeye's survival will depend on its ability to comply
  with provisions of the debt restructuring and regulatory
  agreements and on its ability to return to profitable
  operations, it said.
      There can be no assurance that Hawkeye will be able to meet
  these requirements. However, the company ""believes it will be
  able to do so,"" Hawkeye said.

test/17620,"DUTCH OFFICIAL RATE CUT SEEN STILL LIKELY
  A cut of about half a percentage point
  in Dutch official interest rates is still in prospect, although
  economists said the timing would depend on Bundesbank moves.
      Speculation has been rife that the Dutch Central Bank,
  encouraged by a strong guilder/mark relationship and wide
  premiums for Dutch money and capital market rates over German,
  might lower rates without the Bundesbank moving first.
      Last month, the Central Bank lowered its special advances
  rate to 5.1 pct from 5.25 pct after the Bundesbank dropped its
  repurchase tender rate to 3.55 pct from 3.8 pct.
      That rate has remained in force, just holding above the
  five pct official secured loans rate which governs commercial
  bank borrowings.
      Given a strong guilder, a further fall in the West German
  repo rate would trigger a lower special advances tariff,
  forcing an official Dutch rate cut, analysts said.
      In February, when the Bundesbank cut its discount rate to
  three pct from 3.5 pct, the Central Bank only lowered money
  market rates and removed a surcharge over the secured loans
  rate on lending under its three month credit quota.
      Since then, however, both the Central Bank and Finance
  Ministry have made it clear they favour lower official rates.
      In April, Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said he
  would follow any Bundesbank cut, and last week the Finance
  Ministry expressed satisfaction when it raised 2.25 billion
  guilders with a six pct coupon state loan priced at 100.10 pct
  for an effective yield of 5.98 pct, the lowest since 1965.
      Technically, analysts said, there has to be a difference
  between the secured loans rate which applies to lending under
  the credit quota, and the tariff on special advances which add
  extra liquidity to the money market.
      Bank economists and dealers said a West German move to
  further lower the rate on securities repurchase pacts would
  result in the Central Bank easing the special advance rate,
  provided the guilder/mark relationship permitted.
      The Central Bank aims to keep the guilder stable around its
  parity value within the European Monetary System of 112.673
  guilders per 100 marks.
      Today, foreign exchange buying pushed the mark up 10
  guilder cents to 112.705 guilders per 100 at the fix, a level
  that would not permit a change in the interest rate
  differential between West Germany and the Netherlands, dealers
  said.
      An economist at ABN Bank said he expected West German and
  Dutch interest rates to ease in the short term. However, he
  said new wage agreements in West Germany had raised inflation
  expectations which would put upward pressure on interest rates
  in the longer term.
      In the Netherlands, the inflation outlook for 1987 is nil,
  or even negative, while the latest official economic forecasts
  point to a falling rate of economic growth.
      ""It will depend on the outcome of collective wage agreement
  negotiations here whether there could be cost push inflation,""
  the ABN economist said.
      He said Dutch money supply growth, which ran at 3.4 pct in
  January, could also contribute to some inflation.
      At Amro Bank, a leading analyst said inflation could run to
  two pct next year. The bank expects Dutch capital market rates,
  currently averaging around 6.1 pct, to stop easing in the
  second half of this year and stabilize around 5.6 pct.
      Analysts said an official rate cut could trigger a buying
  spree on the bond market which would bring yields down,
  probably only temporarily, while money rates could fall below
  five pct.
      Currently, all periods are traded at 5.12 to 5.25 pct in
  the money market.

test/20868,"BAKER/STOLTENBERG MEETING SOOTHES MARKETS
  News of a meeting between U.S. Treasury
  Secretary James Baker and West German Finance Minister Gerhard
  Stoltenberg on Monday soothed currency markets, allowing the
  dollar to recoup much of the day's losses, dealers said.
      News of the meeting, which took place in Frankfurt in great
  secrecy, came after the dollar fell sharply on criticism by
  Baker of West German monetary policy, which had provoked fears
  that the Louvre pact on currency stability was in jeopardy.
      The dollar reacted immediately to the news, rising over two
  pfennigs in after hours New York trading, dealers there said.
      The announcement of the meeting, also attended by
  Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, was made simultaneously
  in Bonn and Washington, timed for after the closure of New York
  markets.
      Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl agreed to pursue the policies
  accepted under the February Louvre accord, a finance ministry
  spokesman in Bonn said.
      The dollar rose to 1.7970/90 marks from New York's close of
  1.7730/40. It had closed there on Friday at 1.7975/85 marks.
      The dollar had tumbled nearly three pfennigs as the market
  reacted to Baker's criticism of rising West German interest
  rates, and stock markets crashed worldwide. Baker had said that
  West Germany was apparently breaching the Louvre accord.
      Under the accord, leading industrial democracies pledged to
  coordinate economic policies to foster currency stability, with
  the surplus countries, West Germany and Japan, stimulating
  their economies and the U.S. promising to cut its budget
  deficit.
      West German government sources said rising West German
  money market rates could not be seen as a breach of the Louvre
  pact. They were rather a direct reaction to higher interest
  rates in the United States. U.S. Bond yields have been rising
  since May on inflationary fears and in early September the Fed
  raised the discount rate to 6.00 pct from 5.50.
      German yields have also risen over this period, but less
  markedly, and since late September the Bundesbank has nudged up
  short-term rates by changing the terms on its security
  repurchase pacts, its principal instrument for steering the
  money market.
      The allocation rate on the last facility was 3.85 pct,
  compared with 3.60 pct. This was partly due to West Germany's
  inability to uncouple itself from U.S. interest rate trends,
  but also reflected concern among monetary conservatives in the
  Bundesbank central bank council about excessive monetary
  growth, which raised fears of domestically produced inflation,
  bank economists said.
      This monetary tightening reflected a switch from the
  pragmatic line pursued by Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl
  since early this year to stabilise the mark externally, to the
  more cautious approach of Vice President Helmut Schlesinger.
      In an apparent gesture to Baker, coinciding with his visit,
  the Bundesbank repeatedly added money market liquidity this
  morning. Dealers said this was clearly a move to appease U.S.
  anger over the most recent West German interest rate rises.
      ""They (the Bundesbank) just don't want to come too much
  under American fire,"" said Chris Zwermann, currency adviser at
  Swiss Bank Corp here.
      ""It seems to me that this is the Bundesbank beating quite a
  significant retreat from its position,"" added Giles Keating,
  economist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd in London.
      The significance that retreat will emerge from the terms of
  the Bundesbank's next tender for a securities repurchase pact
  on Tuesday, and its result on Wednesday, money market
  economists said.
      Today's injection of liquidity shows that the Bundesbank
  does not want a further strong rise in the tender allocation
  rate, which is likely to turn out at between 3.80 and 3.90 pct,
  little changed from the 3.85 pct on the last facility.
      The Bundesbank and Finance Ministry had given no indication
  that the meeting would take place, although the Finance
  Ministry spokesman said it had been arranged last week.
      Earlier on Monday the Finance Ministry spokesman, asked to
  comment on the apparent U.S.-German clash over the Louvre
  accord, went no further than quoting Stoltenberg as saying he
  assumed monetary cooperation would continue.
      The spokesman said he believed Baker had already left West
  Germany for Sweden on Monday. This week he is also due to visit
  Denmark and Belgium.

  Unidentified jets attacked three Iranian
  oil rigs in the southern Gulf early on Monday, setting at least
  one of them ablaze, regional shipping sources said.
      Earlier today in Washington, U.S. Television networks had
  reported that American forces launched a retaliatory strike
  against Iran late Sunday, attacking two Iranian offshore oil
  drilling platforms and setting them ablaze.
      The shipping sources said Iran's Sassan, Rostam and Rakhsh
  offshore oilfields were attacked at 0700 local (0300 GMT) by a
  wave of jet fighter bombers. Smoke was seen spiralling up from
  the Rostam field soon after.
      At least one of the other two targets was also believed to
  be ablaze, the sources said.
      The Sassan and Rostam fields have been targets for Iraqi
  air strikes in the past, but Baghdad had not reported any
  southern Gulf missions prior to news of the latest attack.
      Shipping and military sources in the region have said Iran
  used its southern Gulf rigs as bases to launch helicopter and
  later speedboat attacks on neutral ships in the waterway.
      U.S. Officials had been meeting on a response since Friday
  when an attack on a Kuwaiti port severely damaged a
  U.S.-flagged ship. President Reagan said on Sunday he had
  already made a decision on the U.S. Response to Friday's Iran
  attack but would not say what the decision was.

  A trade bill before the United States
  House of Representatives ""is a very dangerous bill for Canadian
  industry,"" Canadian Forest Industry Council chairman Adam
  Zimmerman told reporters.
      By changing the definition of subsidy under U.S.
  countervailing duty law, House of Representatives Bill 3
  removes protection for companies that take advantage of widely
  used government programs, Zimmerman told a media briefing.
      ""Clearly, any industry to which Canadian governments grant
  rights to fish, mine, cut timber, or produce power could be
  vulnerable to a finding of a subsidy under this language,"" he
  said.
      The Canadian forest lobby's Zimmerman also said the House
  of Representative Bill would adopt a new way of measuring
  subsidies that would greatly increase the size of any
  countervailing duties that might be imposed on Canadian
  resource exports to the U.S.
      Under the bill, any difference between Canadian prices and
  U.S. or world market prices would constitute a subsidy, he
  said. Such a method would make Canadian resource industries
  vulnerable to similar penalties like a 15 pct export tax
  imposed last January on shipments of Canadian softwood lumber
  to the U.S., Zimmerman added.
      Canadian negotiators agreed to levy the new tax if a U.S.
  forest industry lobby would drop its request for a countervail
  duty on imports of Canadian softwood lumber.
      ""We represent the first victim of the move to price other
  countries' natural resources according to the U.S. system,""
  Zimmerman said.
      ""If we're an example, than other resource industries had
  better watch out,"" he added.
      Zimmerman said the Canadian Forest Industry Council plans
  to discuss concerns about the U.S. trade bill with lobby groups
  from other Canadian resource industries.

  includes provisions that may force the company to sell its 42

  Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
      Dome said in the filing that its debt plan proposes making
  payments under a five year income debenture to the lender whose
  debt is secured by Dome's Encor shares.
      After the five years are up, ""under certain circumstances

      Analysts have said Commerce Bank was pressing Dome to sell
  the stock to pay down its debt.
      Dome's Encor shares had a market value of 313 mln dlrs on
  March 17, 1987, the company's filing said.
      As previously reported, Dome is seeking approval in
  principle for the debt restructuring plan. Dome said in the
  filing it proposed lenders sign a letter of understanding in
  early April, with implementation to be effective July 1, 1987.
      Dome Petroleum reiterated in the SEC filing that its
  existence as a going concern is dependent on continuing the

  agreement for its proposed restructuring plan.

  would not be sold separately from the pipeline.
      Concerning speculation that two billion dlr price tag for

  measures under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and
  other actions if the United States imposes 100 pct tariffs on

  America to call off the threatened tariffs during two days of

  retaliation for what he called Japan's failure to honour a July
  1986 agreement to stop dumping computer microchips in markets
  outside the United States and to open its home market to
  American goods.
      Fukukawa said the United States had regrettably not

  The operator of a major U.S. crude oil
  pipeline, shutdown because of flood damage, said it may be
  several days before repairs are made and the system is
  functioning again.
      Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at
  Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, operator of the pipeline through its
  subsidiary Texaco Pipeline Co, said the company hopes repairs
  will begin in about five days and expects it to take several
  more days to complete.
      ""At this point we are lining up what we know we need, to get
  the job done,"" Stevens said, adding that the timing for repairs
  will depend on the damage to the pipeline which is difficult to
  assess because of flooding on the Red River.
      The pipeline was shipping roughly 225,000 barrels of crude
  oil per day, or about 55 pct of its capacity during the 30 days
  preceding its shutdown on Saturday, Stevens said.
      The pipeline was shut down from Cushing, Okla, to Witchita
  Falls, Kan, on Saturday due to an undetermined leak at the Red
  River crossing, near the Oklahoma/Texas border, because of
  severe rains, a spokesman for Texaco said.
      Stevens said it was reasonable to suggest the pipeline
  could operate at full capacity when it reopens in order to make
  up for the shortfull but cautioned they will talk with
  customers to determine their requirements.
      Oil analysts and traders said they were not sure if the 
  shutdown will continue to raise U.S. oil prices.
      Monday, after Texaco confirmed that the pipeline had been
  closed, West Texas Intermediate crude in the spot market and on
  New York Mercantile Exchange's energy futures complex rose 20
  cts a barrel.

  E.F. Hutton LBO Inc said the tender
  offer by its wholly owned unit, PC Acquisition Inc, for
  Purolator Courier Corp &lt;PCC> expired at 2400 EDT yesterday
  without the purchase of any Purolator common stock.
      Hutton added that PC Acquisition also terminated its merger
  agreement with Purolator.
      Hutton said the offer, which had been conditioned upon the
  tender of at least 5,116,892 Purolator shares, or about
  two-thirds of the outstanding shares, was terminated because
  the minimum number of shares was not tendered.
      Purolator had entered into a definitive agreement with PC
  Acquisition, part-owned by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc, a unit of E.F.
  Hutton, and some officers of Purolator's U.S. courier division,
  in which PC offered to purchase 6,332,471 Purolator common
  stock shares for 35 dlrs a share.
      Following that move, PC Acquisition planned to merge a
  subsidiary into Purolator, converting all outstanding Purolator
  common it did not own into an aggregate 46 mln dlrs principal
  amount of 12 pct guaranteed debentures due 2002 and warrants to
  purchase 15 pct of a Purolator unit comprised of Purolator's
  U.S courier operations.
      Hutton said as of 2400 EDT yesterday about 181,000 shares
  of Purolator common stock, or about 2.4 pct of the outstanding
  shares, had been validly tendered and not withdrawn.
      PC Acquisition has instructed its depository for the offer
  to return promptly the Purolator stock deposited by, or on
  behalf of, tendering shareholders, Hutton said.

test/20878,"VENEZUELA BACKS INCREASE IN ECUADOR OPEC QUOTA
  Venezuela will back Ecuador's bid to
  raise its OPEC quota above 221,000 barrels per day (bpd)
  because it is a justifiable demand, Venezuelan Energy Minister
  Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said on Monday.
      He told reporters the country deserved a higher quota in
  compensation for the five months it was forced to suspend oil
  production when its main pipeline was destroyed by an
  earthquake last March.
      ""For this five-month period, Ecuador did not exercise its
  right to produce 221,000 bpd,"" he said. ""We should recognize
  Ecuador's right to increase its quota ... There is a basis of
  justice in that country's petition.""
      He added however, the quota increase should be gradual to
  avoid harming the market, he added.
      Hernandez Grisanti said he understood Ecuador would
  formally submit the request for a higher quota at the next
  ministerial conference of the Organization of Petroleum
  Exporting Countries (OPEC) opening December 9 in Vienna.

test/20216,"CRAZY EDDIE &lt;CRZY.O> AMENDS SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS
  Crazy Eddie Inc said its board of
  directors amended the company's shareholder rights plan in
  moves it said were designed to preserve stockholder protection
  and provide flexibility to the plan.
      Yesterday, Crazy Eddie agreed not to oppose a slate of
  candidates to its board proposed by the Committee to Restore
  Stockholder Value, a shareholder group led by the
  &lt;Oppenheimer-Palmieri Fund L.P.> and Entertainment Marketing
  Inc &lt;EM>, that has been seeking to oust current management.
      Crazy Eddie said the new amendments limit future amendments
  to the plan, modify the definition of ""continuing directors""
  and permit amendment or termination of the plan with the
  consent of the company's shareholders if there are no
  continuing directors in office or the approval of at least
  three such directors cannot be obtained.
      The company also said it approved a certificate of
  designation with respect to its 4.5 mln shares of authorized,
  but previously undesignated and unissued shares of preferred
  stock and adopted an employee stock ownership plan.
      Crazy Eddie also that it requested that the shareholder
  group make a commitment not to take the company private until
  Crazy Eddie has had a chance to recover from current financial
  difficulties, a committment that the group rejected.
      Crazy Eddie said it will hold its annual shareholders
  meeting on November 6.

test/21131,"AMPLE SUPPLIES LIMIT U.S. STRIKE'S OIL PRICE IMPACT
  Ample supplies of OPEC crude weighing on
  world markets helped limit and then reverse oil price gains
  that followed the U.S. Strike on an Iranian oil platform in the
  Gulf earlier on Monday, analysts said.
      December loading rose to 19.65 dlrs, up 45 cents before
  falling to around 19.05/15 later, unchanged from last Friday.
      ""Fundamentals are awful,"" said Philip Lambert, analyst with
  stockbrokers Kleinwort Grieveson, adding that total OPEC
  production in the first week of October could be above 18.5 mln
  bpd, little changed from September levels.
      Peter Nicol, analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank, said OPEC
  production could be about 18.5-19.0 mln in October. Reuter and
  International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates put OPEC September
  production at 18.5 mln bpd.
      The U.S. Attack was in retaliation of last Friday's hit of
  a Kuwaiti oil products tanker flying the U.S. Flag, the Sea
  Isle City. It was struck by a missile, believed to be Iranian,
  in Kuwaiti waters, and was the first hit on a U.S. Flag
  commercial vessel in the seven year Iran/Iraq war.
      The U.S. Owned Liberian flag tanker Sungari was hit in the
  area on Thursday, also believed struck by an Iranian missile.
      Refiners were not significant purchasers of physical oil on
  Monday as a result increased Gulf tension following the U.S.
  Attack, analysts said.
      They said a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, through which
  around eight mln bpd passes, isnlikely because it is not in
  the interests of the U.S. Or Iran, they said.
      Any threat to oil supplies would stem from an increase in
  the number of tanker attacks as part of a widening of Gulf
  hostilities, analysts said.
      But they saw the U.S. Strike as a limited reply to Iranian
  missile attacks, with some describing it as responsible.
      Geoffrey Pyne, analyst at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew,
  said he was impressed by the sensible U.S. Response.
      ""The U.S. Has thought carefully about what would correspond
  to Iranian agression. They have proved to the Iranians that any
  further action will be met with a like-for-like response.
  Today's action by the U.S. Was not escalatory,"" Pyne said.
      Kleinwort Grieveson's Lambert said the U.S. Strike was ""a
  responsible retaliation,"" with the U.S. Apparently indicating to
  Iran that it could increase the severity of its attacksf Iran
  chose to raise the level of conflict.
      Chase Manhattan's Nicol took a different view, however.
      He said he was unable to see what the U.S. Had achieved as
  Arab states such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, whose interests
  the U.S. Is supposedly defending, will feel less secure as a
  result of the U.S. Attack and fear some sort of Iranian
  retaliation.
      The initial upward market move this morning reflected a
  strong speculative reaction to rumours of a U.S. Attack which
  was thought at one stage to have been against Iranian missile
  launchers on the Faw Peninsula, close to Kuwait, analysts said.
      The later downtrend followed confirmation of a U.S. Navy
  attack on an Iranian oil platform by the U.S. Defence Secretary
  Caspar Weinburger.
      Market operators were able to evaluate the situation in the
  Gulf on the basis of confirmed fact, and finding it less
  serious than first thought, took profits, taking prices lower,
  analysts and traders said.

  Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F>,
  VW, is due to make a formal announcement about its 1986
  dividend tomorrow after saying the 1985 level of 10 marks per
  ordinary share would be held, despite massive losses because of
  a suspected foreign currency fraud.
      A spokesman said VW's supervisory board will meet tomorrow
  to discuss the payout.  A statement will be made afterwards.
      VW has also said disclosed profits for 1986 will reach
  their 1985 level, despite provisions of a possible 480 mln
  marks linked to the currency affair. The figure is virtually
  the same as the 477 mln mark 1985 parent company net profit.
      When VW first confirmed the currency scandal on March 10 it
  said the management board would propose an unchanged 10-mark
  dividend to the supervisory board. A dividend of 11 marks would
  be proposed for the company's new preference shares.
      Share analysts said they saw supervisory board approval of
  the management board proposal as virtually a formality.
  ""Anything else would be more than a surprise,"" one said.
      Company sources said VW would have to dig into reserves to
  maintain the disclosed profit. Parent company reserves stood at
  around three billion marks at end-1985.

  The Bundesbank is unlikely to change
  credit policies when its central bank council meets on Thursday
  for its last session before the Venice summit, banking
  economists and money market dealers said.
      The Bundesbank steered money market rates lower last month
  by cutting the rate on its security repurchase pacts, and is
  unlikely to cap this move with a cut in leading interest rates
  in the near future, they said.
      The council will meet in Saarbruecken, and the meeting will
  be followed by a news conference at around 1030 GMT.
      But Bundesbank officials noted that a news conference was
  usually called when the council meets outside Frankfurt, and
  did not necessarily herald any policy moves.
      Bundesbank Vice-President Helmut Schlesinger said today
  there was no reason to cut interest rates because money supply
  growth had shown no signs of slowing in May and the dollar was
  stable against the mark.
      Schlesinger told Reuters in Tokyo, where the Bundesbank has
  opened a representative office, that the West German economy
  was now picking up after contracting by a seasonally adjusted
  1/2 to one pct in the first quarter.
      Money market dealers said call money was likely to hold in
  a 3.50/70 pct range for most of this month, after the
  Bundesbank switched last month to tenders by interest rate at a
  minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct, allocating funds at 3.55 pct.
      ""They have set this signal and indicated they could maybe
  lower market rates even further, but not with the discount or
  Lombard,"" Winfried Hutmann, chief economist of Schroeder,
  Munchmeyer, Hengst Investment GmbH said.
      Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said
  German rates were among the lowest in industrial countries and
  around historical lows for West Germany.
      A further cut in rates would have little impact on the
  economy as banks are in any case reporting slack credit demand,
  with companies swimming in liquidity, Chrobok said.
      The Bundesbank would therefore be reluctant to make a move
  on interest rates, when this would be better held in reserve.
  ""The Bundesbank is frightened of using up its powder,"" he said.
      A cut in the discount or Lombard rates, to bring them in
  line with the new structure of money market rates since last
  month, would have little practical significance, dealers said.
      The Bundesbank could therefore act on these if it wanted a
  diplomatic gesture before next week's Venice summit.
      But Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl has often made it
  clear in the past he opposes such gestures as mere ""eyewash.""
      Economists said it was really up to the Bonn government to
  cut taxes, rather than for the Bundesbank to ease monetary
  policy, to meet pressure on West Germany at the Venice summit.
      But with Bonn struggling to finance already announced tax
  cuts and falling tax revenue widening the federal budget
  deficit, it is hard to see how Bonn could cut taxes further.
      ""The Bonn government will be in a very weak position in
  Venice because they can't risk increasing the deficit further,""
  said Schroeder, Muenchmeyer, Hengst's Hutmann.
      Bethmann's Chrobok said if anything is to happen before
  Venice, it must be in fiscal rather than monetary policy. ""But I
  don't expect any convincing measures,"" he said.
      Money market dealers noted that call money continued to
  normalize today, falling to 3.60/70 pct from 3.75/85 yesterday
  and as much as five pct on Friday when it was pushed up by
  month-end distortions.
      Call money could come under upwards pressure later this
  month because of a major round of tax payments by banks on
  behalf of customers, starting in the week beginning June 15.
  Two public holidays that week could also distort the market.
      Dealers said they expected the Bundesbank to allocate funds
  tomorrow in the latest repurchase pact at an unchanged 3.55
  pct, after setting an unchanged minimum bid rate of 3.50 pct,
  and to fully replace the 5.5 billion marks in an outgoing pact.
      But dealers said it was possible the Bundesbank would
  allocate funds at 3.6 pct rather than 3.55. That would not
  represent a tightening of policy, however.
      Because the Bundesbank scales down bids which it allocates
  at the minimum accepted rate, some banks may try to get a full
  allocation by bidding heavily at 3.6 pct, dealers said.
      On another issue, Poehl has said the Bundesbank is likely
  to lift restrictions on private use of the European Currency
  Unit (ECU) at one of its meetings soon.
      Saarbruecken would be a suitable place for an announcement
  on this gesture to European unity, as it is the capital of the
  Saarland bordering France, and was twice under French
  occupation this century.
      But dealers said an ECU announcement was unlikely to come
  this week, as a number of technical and legal matters had still
  to be resolved, for instance how German ECU accounts would be
  treated for minimum reserve purposes.

      ""They will be determined. They will not be easily deterred,

  Crowe told an American Stock Exchange conference.

test/18938,"GILLETTE &lt;GS> SEEN OBJECT OF GLOBAL BIDDING WAR
  Ronald Perelman, head of Revlon Group
  Inc &lt;REV>, may be trying to ignite a bidding war for Gillette
  Co that could draw some big international players and in the
  process make a lot of money for himself, Wall Street analysts
  said.
      Several hours before a regularly scheduled board of
  directors meeting, Gillette disclosed that Perelman requested
  consent of its board for an offer of at least 40.50 dlrs per
  share. Perelman needed the consent because he agreed in
  November not to buy stock for 10 years without permission.
      ""I think Ronald Perelman is less interested in Gillette and
  more interested in putting Gillette into play because he stands
  to make a ton of money,"" said Andrew Shore, analyst at Shearson
  Lehman Brothers Inc. ""In play"" is a term used on Wall Street to
  describe what happens when a company becomes an unwiling
  takeover target.
      Shore noted that according to the 1986 agreement Revlon
  gets paid if there is any acquisition of Gillette through
  November of this year at a price higher than 29.75 dlrs per
  share. Gillette rose three to 40 today, following a gain of
  three yesterday.
      The agreement would be calculated on the basis of
  Perelman's previous holding of 18.4 mln shares, adjusted for a
  split. For example, a deal between Gillette and some other
  company at 44 dlrs per share would make Revlon richer by 262
  mln dlrs under the formula. Neither Perelman nor his spokesmen
  returned telephone calls seeking comment.
      ""Revlon stands to make a substantial amount of money if
  someone else takes over Gillette,"" said Analyst Deepak Raj of
  Merrill Lynch and Co. ""I'm not saying that is going to happen
  but Gillette is an undervalued stock with a breakup value of 45
  dlrs per share.""
      Shore of Shearson Lehman said there are a couple of reasons
  why Perelman may not be really interested in acquiring
  Gillette. He said Perelman, in the process of taking Revlon
  private after acquiring control of the cosmetics company two
  years ago, probably wants to concentrate on improving Revlon's
  operations. ""He's trying to overhaul and improve the image of
  the dearptment store business."" Another reason is that Revlon
  has recently made two other acquisitions.
      Under those circumstances, Shore would not be surprised if
  some company such as Unilever plc &lt;UN.AS> or Procter and Gamble
  Co &lt;PG> decided to take a look at Gillette.
      Shore mentioned half a dozen other potential buyers for
  Gillette including Sir James Goldsmith, Hanson Trust plc &lt;HAN>,
  RJR Nabisco Inc &lt;RJR>, American Brands Inc &lt;AMB> and Ralston
  Purina Co &lt;RAL>.
      ""Perelman is trying to put the company in play,"" said a
  Wall Street arbitrageur. ""He gets to share in the upside if the
  company is sold."" Another arbitrageur said he expects Gillette
  to resist Perelman's overture. ""I can't see the board
  consenting, what has changed between November and now,"" he
  said.
     
      Another arbitrageur said he was not sure what was going on.
  ""Perelman never does anything without a fair amount of
  calculation,"" he said. But he added, ""The Gillette board has to
  be careful. They just can't say no or they'll be sued by
  shareholders."" Gillette's board was still meeting at 1700 EDT,
  three and one-half hours after the scheduled starting time.
      According to a copy of Perelman's letter released by
  Gillette, he would be prepared to sign a defnitive merger
  agreement without any financing condition. He said Citibank
  N.A. is his lead lender and First Boston Inc is his financial
  adviser.

  Ministry of International Trade and

  Japan has violated a pact on microchip trade.
      A three-man Japanese trade team is already in Washington
  laying the groundwork for talks between Kuroda and Deputy U.S.
  Trade Representative Michael Smith aimed at persuading the U.S.
  Not to impose tariffs on certain Japanese products.
      But Kuroda said he is taking no new proposals. ""I have
  nothing in my briefcase except an explanation of the current
  situation,"" Kuroda told the daily newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
      Kuroda said the U.S. Decision was based on incorrect data
  and an exaggerated sense of MITI's power to control market
  forces. ""The U.S. Has excessive expectations. To stabilise
  supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess
  inventories since 1985 will take some time,"" he said.
      Kuroda also laid part of the blame for low U.S. Chip sales
  in Japan on a lack of effort by American firms here.
      He said if he fails in talks tomorrow and Friday to
  forestall sanctions, he will seek further talks with U.S. Trade
  Representative Clayton Yeutter. U.S. Officials said this week's
  talks are unlikely to delay imposition of tariffs.

  The Louvre agreement by the Group of Seven
  finance ministers and central bankers to stabilise currencies
  has worked well and needs no fundamental strengthening at the
  economic summit in Venice on June 8-10, U.K. Chancellor of the
  Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.
      Previewing the summit, which he expected would not produce
  any major new economic initiatives, Lawson told reporters work
  remained to be done on improving the conditions for lasting
  world economic growth.üside measures to boost growth, he said.
  
      ""I think it is possible that there may be scope for a
  further reduction in interest rates in Germany,"" he added, but
  stressed that he had had no indication that such a move was
  likely. He made no mention of Japanese interest rates.
      Lawson said the U.S. Should embark on ""a gradual reduction
  of its fiscal deficits over the next two or three years.""
      He said the February 22 Louvre accord had produced
  ""satisfactory exchange rate stability,"" in part thanks to heavy
  coordinated intervention of Group of Seven central banks, and
  he was ""content"" with sterling's exchange rate.
      Pointing to the record 4.8 billion stg rise in U.K. May
  currency reserves announced today he said, ""we have been playing
  a very full part ourselves ... We have been intervening to a
  very much greater extent than we had done hitherto.""
      Lawson said there was a risk that the Louvre agreement may
  falter if member states did not implement the macro-economic
  commitments underlying the accord.
      ""Certainly it would be more difficult to maintain exchange
  rate stability if countries are seen not to implement their
  commitments in Paris ... In this respect."" He said the U.S.
  Budget deficit was ""very important.""
      Noting the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by
  Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone last week Lawson
  said, ""what is really needed in Japan is an increase in
  merchandise imports. Supply side measures are critical.""
      ""There is a specific range of consumer and agricultural
  goods where they have an extremely restrictive regime which is
  wholly unjustified,"" he said.
      Lawson doubted that Tokyo's partners would indulge in ""Japan
  bashing"" at the summit especially after the economic stimulation
  package and the announcement of Nakasone's plans to increase
  Japanese development aid over the next three years.
      Japan's more flexible stance on Tokyo stock exchange
  membership would also help deflect criticism, he said.
      He said he thought West Germany would instead come under
  pressure at the summit to adopt similar stimulation measures to
  jack up faltering economic growth.
      In this respect Lawson said he hoped Bonn would bring
  forward to January 1988 part of its agreed package of tax cuts
  scheduled for 1990. He also called on Bonn to push ahead with
  the privatisation of German national industries.
      On debt, Lawson said he expected a three point British plan
  to alleviate the burden of the poorest sub-saharan countries to
  make progress in Venice.
      The plan, involving concessional rescheduling of sovereign
  debt in the Paris Club, was first proposed at the IMF and World
  Bank meetings in Washington earlier this year.
      Lawson said he would seek ""to consolidate political backing
  for the plan at the Venice summit"" and hoped the programme would
  be finalised at the Autumn meetings of the IMF and World Bank.
      He welcomed the recent moves by Citicorp and Chase
  Manhattan to increase sharply their Third World debt
  provisions.
      ""First, it is a blow for realism. Second, because the market
  response has shown that banks have much less to fear from this
  sort of move than they felt before Citicorp,"" he said.
      U.K. Banks should follow Bank of England recommendations,
  strengthening their balance sheets and making more provisions.
  ""They have done it to some extent, they need to do it more,""
  Lawson said, adding it was up to the banks themselves to
  determine the appropriate size of provisions.
      He also said the dismantling of farm subsidies would be
  discussed at the summit. ""There is a consensus, which we have to
  push further.""

test/17593,"U.K. BANKERS CONSIDER NEW ECGD FINANCING PLAN
  Representatives of major U.K. Based banks
  are meeting here today to consider a new plan for reducing the
  cost of financing British exports guaranteed by the Export
  Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD), senior banking sources
  said.
      The plan is being developed in conjunction with the ECGD
  and the Bank of England.
      Neither the ECGD nor the Bank of England would comment on
  the plan. However, bankers said one of the main points under
  discussion is a plan to refinance the bulk of the ECGD's medium
  term credit portfolio in the international capital markets.
  
      The proposals involve introducing a set of interest margins
  on ECGD backed debt of 5/16 to 7/8 pct, depending on the size
  and maturity of the credit and the currency.
      The banks are likely to push for a higher margin. Bankers
  said that while these rates would reduce a bank's return they
  would still be more than those proposed about a year ago when
  the government attempted unsuccessfully to initiate another
  cost reduction plan.
      At the same time, the banks would be expected to allow the
  ECGD to realise additional savings by refinancing existing
  government backed credit in the capital markets.
  
      On credits that are refinanced an original lender would
  receive a residual margin of 7/16 pct for loans up to 10 mln
  stg and 3/16 pct on larger transactions.

test/19875,"INTEREST RATES HURT U.S. MAY HOUSING SALES
  Sales of new single-family homes
  tumbled 14.9 pct in May from April levels because of higher
  mortgage interest rates, analysts said.
      ""There should be another month or two of very weak new home
  sales but with interest rates stabilizing, sale of new homes
  should become more stable by mid-summer,"" said economist
  Lawrence Chimerine of Wharton Econometrics Inc.
      The drop in May, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
  616,000 units, was the largest since January 1982, the Commerce
  Department said.
      Interest rates on conventional mortgages bottomed out at
  about 9.08 pct in March and rose to about 10.7 pct in April,
  according to Stephen Roach, economist at Morgan Stanley.
      The effect was to freeze some potential new homebuyers out
  of the market, he and others said.
      ""The rates moved very suddenly and were certainly
  unexpected by homebuyers,"" said Cynthia Latta, an economist
  with Data Resources. ""They were so startled, they wanted to
  hold back and see what would happen.""
      The drop in sales of new single-family home sales was
  sharper than expected, some economists said. ""We fully expected
  a decline but the extent was more than we anticipated,"" said
  James Christian, chief economist for the U.S. League of Savings
  Institutions.
      Christian said there was a sharp rise in May in sales of
  existing homes, which are generally less expensive than new
  homes.
      Latta of Data Resources said strong sales of new
  condominiums in the Northeast and on the West Coast were
  reflected in sales of existing but not new homes.
      Christian of the U.S. League of Savings Institutions said,
  ""Underlying housing demand remains strong. I think the market
  is going to stabilize and give us a good second half.""
      Others were less optimistic, however.
      ""We clearly won't have a boom (in new home sales) but I
  don't think this is the start of a collapse in single-family
  housing,"" said Chimerine of Wharton.
      Eugene Sherman, chief economist of the Federal Home Loan
  Bank of New York, said, ""The lower sales level will be
  maintained for awhile until there is another change in rates.
  There won't be much specific improvement in coming months.""

  The Agriculture Ministry declined comment
  on a local newspaper report that Japan had agreed to hold talks
  on its closed rice market in the new GATT round.
      ""We have no idea about the report and cannot comment,"" a
  spokesman told Reuters.
      Nihon Keizai Shinbun, quoting unnamed government sources,
  said Japan would tell U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
  and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter of its
  intentions. The two are due to visit Japan later this month for
  farm talks.
      The U.S. Has been pressing Japan to discuss the rice issue
  at the new round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
  talks. But Japan has said GATT is not the right forum.
      Imports of rice to Japan are banned under the Foodstuff
  Control Act.
      Nihon Keizai said Japan's plan resulted from worries about
  mounting trade tension with the U.S. At the GATT talks, Japan
  will try to persuade the U.S. That its rice policy is
  justified, it said.
      The 93-nation world trade body began the Uruguay trade
  round last September. It will take four years to negotiate.

  Member states of the European
  Community are starting to run out of patience with Japan which
  they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open
  its market to imports, but as often made only minor moves.
      Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC
  countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the
  willingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanese
  government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC.
      However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, as
  EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan.
     Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to
  an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could
  raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S.
  Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17.
      The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations
  entered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designed
  to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of
  the U.S.
      The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's
  trade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in
  March, up from 1.94 billion in February.

  U.S.-Canadian ties could worsen if
  the two nations are unable to reach a free trade pact,
  according to a study published by two nonpartisan public policy
  research groups.
      The Cato Institute of Washington and the Fraser Institute
  of Vancouver said removing the remaining tariffs on cross
  border trade would benefit both countries.
      But Cato chairman William Niskanen added ""the two nations'
  generally harmonious trade relations are probably not
  sustainable without a new agreement.""
      The United States and Canada, whose cross-border trade
  totaled about 125 billion dlrs last year, have been holding
  talks since last June on a pact to end the few trade barriers
  remaining between their two countries.
      The U.S. put a deadline on the talks of October 1, but both
  sides have said an agreement is likely despite tough bargaining
  remained.
      Niskanen said if no pact is reached, bilateral trade ties
  could deteriorate because of Congressional pressure on
  President Reagan to implement trade laws more aggressively, and
  this could hit some Canadian trade practices.
      He noted Canada is seeking foreign investment in its auto
  industry, which could put strains on the considerable bilateral
  free trade in U.S. and Canadian autos and parts.
      Niskanen also said the Canadian government is vulnerable to
  a resurgence of economic nationalism which could restrict U.S.
  exports to Canada.
      A free trade pact, backed by President Reagan and Prime
  Minister Brian Mulroney, would open new markets for Canada and
  enable its industries to achieve economies of scale, which
  would also help it widen exports worldwide, he said.
      It would also increase the gross national products of both
  countries.
      Niskanen said the goal of a pact should be to end all
  tariffs within 10 years, lower subsidies on exports, set rules
  for trade in services and investments, end curbs on government
  procurement and agree ways to resolve trade disputes.

test/19483,"UPTREND REMAINS INTACT FOR DEBT FUTURES
  The six basis point rise of the past
  month in U.S. debt futures may be extended next week by a
  series of U.S. economic reports, analysts said, as long as the
  dollar holds firm.
      ""Interest rates have declined by approximately 50 basis
  points over the last month, largely over indications that
  inflation is not as high as people had feared and the narrowing
  U.S. trade balance, in nominal terms,"" Samuel Kahan, chief
  financial economist with Kleinwort Benson Government
  Securities, said.
      Kahan said recent government reports have shown strength in
  the economy during the first quarter, but his concern is
  whether the U.S. economy will sustain that strength in the
  longer term.
      Weak U.S. economic growth could hurt the dollar, which has
  become more important to the direction of debt futures than the
  beneficial impact on interest rates of a sluggish economy.
      The median trade expectations for Tuesday's U.S. Consumer
  Price Index and Durable Goods reports are up 0.4 pct and down
  1.5 pct, respectively.
      Meanwhile, the eight billion dlr drop in the M-1 money
  supply announced this week was ""surprising, much larger than
  expected,"" according to Kahan. ""Unless quickly reversed,"" such
  a trend ""will ensure that June M-1 growth will be negative,""
  Kahan said.
      Taken in conjunction with M-2 and M-3 aggregates which
  Kahan said have ""slowed to a crawl, below Federal Reserve Board
  annual targets,"" the consequences could be a hint of economic
  weakness down the road, he said.
      Based on chart formations, T-bond futures may be poised for
  further gains, although the advance has been slowed recently,
  analysts said.
      September T-bonds ""are up almost six points since about May
  18,"" Merrill Lynch debt analyst Jim Duggan noted. September
  bond futures climbed from the low of 87 a month ago to over 93
  in mid-June, Duggan said.
      While follow-through buying has aided the advance so far,
  and bouts of short covering have prohibited a slide through
  chart support, the rally in September T-bonds has been thwarted
  above the 93 level.
      ""The 93 level is formidable resistance and must be taken
  out before this activity is anything other than a trading range
  market,"" Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures debt analyst
  Brian Singer said.
      The dollar remains the key fundamental factor, and the U.S.
  currency has made little headway of late, analysts said.
      ""The critical variable remaining in the market is the value
  of the dollar,"" Kahan said.
      Additional influences next week will be possible
  developments ahead of an OPEC members meeting, and the impact
  and size of the U.S. budget deficit, ""although these will not
  be in the forefront of the market early next week,"" Kahan said.
      In looking ahead to the U.S. Treasury mini-refunding
  auctions of 24.25 billion in T-notes on Tuesday, Wednesday and
  Thursday, Singer said the market will likely greet the results
  with little excitement. However, a successful auction could
  prove to be a turning point, depending on prevailing market
  psychology.

  Physio Technology Inc said it

  resignation of chairman and chief executive officer.
      The company said the loss followed four quarters of modest
  profits. In the year ago quarter it earned 11,000 dlrs, or one
  cent a share. For the first half of fiscal 1987, it reported a
  profit of 42,000 dlrs, or two cts a share, compared to a year

  chief executive officer.

  Lane can constitute non-compliance with its Series A
  convertible subordinated debentures due 1996 and a default
  under its agreement with the Merchants Bank of Kansas City.
      It explained a declaration of non-compliance under the
  debentures would create a a default under the loan agreements
  requiring immediate payment of 1.8 mln dlrs of debentures and
  about 450,000 dlrs outstanding under the bank credit line.
      The company said the debenture holders intend to waive the

  The Soviet oil production target for 1988
  has been set at 625 mln tonnes, a rise of eight mln tonnes over
  this year's planned output.
      Oil Minister Vasily Dinkov announced the figure on Tuesday
  at the Supreme Soviet, the country's nominal parliament.
      He said a new development strategy, fuller use of oil
  deposits and better housing and pay for oilmen had allowed an
  upsurge in the oil industry after three years of stagnation
  which began in late 1983.
      Last year the Soviet Union produced 615 mln tonnes of oil,
  slightly short of the target of 616.7 mln.
      January-September figures released at the weekend showed
  Soviet oil output in the first nine months of this year at 467
  mln tonnes. The 1987 target is 617 million.
      Dinkov said the Soviet Union would develop 38 new oil
  deposits in the coming year. He called for speedier geolog
  prospecting across the country to spur the oil industry.
      The Supreme Soviet convened on Monday to endorse the 1988
  budget and plan. The session is expected to end on Tuesday.

test/17503,"FRENCH SAY WHEAT STOCKS FORECAST NO SURPRISE
  The U.S. Department of Agriculture's
  forecast that French end-of-season soft wheat stocks will
  almost double in 1987/88 is premature but would not be
  surprising, according to French cereal organisation officials.
      The Cereals Intervention Board, ONIC, Wheat Producers'
  Association and the National Union of Agricultural and Cereal
  Cooperatives have not yet forecast 1987/88 exports or
  end-of-season stocks.
      However, the officials said the USDA's figure of end
  1987/88 stocks at 5.03 mln tonnes against 1986/87's 2.87 mln
  was not surprising given a record high yield forecast in April.
      The French Feed Cereals Research Institute, ITCF, forecast
  in mid-April an average yield of 6.58 tonnes per hectare for
  soft wheat in 1987/88 compared with 5.6 tonnes in 1986/87 and
  the record high yield of 6.5/6.6 tonnes in 1984.
      This would result in a French soft wheat harvest of around
  31 mln tonnes against 25.5 mln in 1986/87, given a Ministry of
  Agriculture estimate of area planted of 4.66 mln hectares
  against 4.61 mln in 1986/87.
      ONIC's first preliminary forecast of the 1987/88 campaign
  will be released at the beginning of September, an ONIC
  official said.
      Soft wheat exports in 1987/88 were extremely difficult to
  estimate at this stage, both within the European Community and
  to non-EC countries, an ONIC official said.
      He said, however, that among countries to which France
  could increase its wheat exports were Egypt and the Maghreb
  countries (Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia), he said.
      The USDA's forecast of an 11.65 mln tonne maize crop in
  1987/88 against 11.48 mln in 1986/87, while again premature,
  was not out of line with estimates of the French Maize
  Producers Association, AGPM, an AGPM official said.
      Maize plantings would be down in 1987/88 but yields were
  expected to be higher, the AGPM official said.
      It estimated 1987/88 maize plantings of 1.73 mln hectares,
  down seven pct from the 1.87 mln hectares planted in 1986/87.

  Williams Cos said it expected oil and

  operating profits from the pipeline unit should improve from
  49.4 mln dlrs earned last year when a seven mln dlr special
  charge was incurred.
      Williams Pipeline Co took the charge against earnings in
  1986 for the removal of more than 500 miles of old pipeline
  from service and for casualty losses. Companywide, Williams had
  a net loss of 134 mln dlrs on total revenues of 1.85 billion
  dlrs, a decline from profits of 32 mln dlrs on sales of 2.46
  billion in 1985.
      In its annual report, Williams said its Northwest Pipeline
  Corp and Williams Natural Gas Co had natural gas costs that are
  among the lowest in the nation, averaging 2.04 dlrs and 2.07
  dlrs per mcf, respectively, last year. Total natural gas
  reserves for both units declined to 10,010 billion cubic feet
  in 1986 from 11,334 billion cubic feet the previous year.
      The company said its Williams Natural Gas unit, which has
  less take-or-pay exposure than most major pipelines, should
  show improvement in its 1987 operating results because of
  changes tariff and federal tax rates.
      The company's gas marketing business is expected to have
  somewhat lower earnings in 1987 because of competition in its
  operating region, the annual report said. The gas marketing
  unit earned 26.0 mln dlrs on sales of 285.6 mln dlrs last year.
      Williams also said it expected a substantial decline in its
  debt to equity ratio this year because of more than 250 mln
  dlrs received in cash from the sale of Agrico Chemical Co and
  proceeds from the sale and leaseback of Williams
  Telecommunications Co. The telecommunications business, a
  2,000-mile fiber optic system for long distance use, will not
  be profitable until late 1988, Williams said.

  House Speaker Jim Wright predicted
  passage of legislation requiring the Reagan administration to
  provide Congress with a report on its Mideast Gulf policy, but
  a last-minute revolt by an alliance of liberals and
  conservatives left the bill's fate in doubt.
      The legislation was written in the wake of the May 17th
  Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf,
  which killed 37 Americans, and President Reagan's decision to
  protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags
  -- effectively making them American ships.
      Since the administration made known its reflagging plans,
  congressional leaders complained they had not been consulted,
  and some charged the policy could lead the United States into
  the 6 1/2-year-old war between Iran and Iraq.
      The House was to vote today on a bill -- supported by the
  Democratic and Republican congressional leadership and the
  administration -- which demanded a report within seven days on
  plans to meet the security needs of U.S. forces in the gulf.
      The resolution was expected to pass without controversy
  today in the House Foreign Affairs Committee before the full
  House was to take up the bill. But in a surprise move, liberal
  Democrats and conservative Republicans on the committee joined
  in an unusual alliance to oppose the resolution.
      Liberal Democrats said a lack of any restrictions in the
  bill implied consent to Reagan's policies.

      The boards of both companies have approved the merger,
  which will be accomplished through a tender offer by a Boeing
  subsidiary of 37 dlrs a share cash for all of ARGOSystems'

      Under the agreement, the Boeing subsidiary, TBC Holdings
  Corp, will begin the tender offer promptly. If at least 90 pct
  of the shares are not tendered, the offer will be prorated to
  49 pct, the companies said.
      ARGOSystems has granted Boeing an option to buy 1,238,311
  shares or 18.5 pct of the outstanding stock for 37 dlrs a
  share, they said.
      Also, Bill May, chairman of ARGOSystems, and three other
  officers have granted Boeing an option to buy their shares,
  another 8.9 pct of the outstanding stock, for 37 dlrs a share.
      ARGOSystems makes equipment to monitor and analyze military
  communications signals, electronic warfare equipment to monitor
  and jam radar signals and signal processing systems.
      For the nine months ended March 31, 1987, ARGOSystems
  reported earnings more than doubled to 6.3 mln dlrs or 95 cts a
  share from 3.1 mln dlrs or 46 cts. The year-ago period included

      Sales are expected to exceed 100 mln dlrs for the fiscal
  year ending June 30, the companies said in a joint statement.
      The company's backlog is currently more than 180 mln dlrs,

      The tender offer and merger are subject to customary

      The offer closes next Friday. The ministry said in a
  statement 51 pct of the bank's capital had been sold to a solid
  core of large investors, including insurance companies and
  Michelin subsidiary SPIKA, for 145 pct of the public offer
  price. Ten pct of the shares have been reserved for employees,
  who get a five pct discount increased to 20 pct if they keep
  the shares for two years.
      Employees also get one free share for each one bought, if
  the shares are held for at least one year.
      Small investors would receive one free share for every 10
  bought, with an upper limit of five free shares per investor,
  and on condition the shares are held for at least 18 months.
      The state-owned capital of BIMP comprises 2.51 mln shares.
  The bank is being sold to the public as part of a sweeping
  programme to privatise 65 state-owned groups over five years.
      In a separate statement, the ministry said last week's

test/21006,"DIPLOMATS CALL U.S. ATTACK ON OIL RIG RESTRAINED
  A U.S. attack on an Iranian oil platform
  in the Gulf on Monday appeared to be a tit-for-tat raid
  carefully orchestrated not to be too provocative or upset Arab
  allies, Western diplomats in the region said.
      U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger said Monday that
  U.S. Warships destroyed the oil platform in the southern Gulf
  in response to a missile strike on the American-registered
  Kuwaiti tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.
      ""We consider the matter closed,"" he said, a signal the U.S.
  administration did not want the Gulf crisis to escalate.
      Iran had warned the United States earlier in the day
  against exacerbating the Gulf crisis, saying military action
  would endanger American interests.
      Following the raid, a okesman for Tehran's War
  Information Headquarters vowed to avenge the attack with a
  ""crushing blow.""
      ""The United States has entered a swamp from which it can in
  no way get out safely,"" Tehran Radio quoted him as saying.
      Diplomats noted, however, Iran was also seeking to avoid
  ostracism by Arab states due to meet at a summit in Amman on
  November 8 and discuss the Iran-Iraq war.
      Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi is currently in
  Damascus, and diplomats said he would seek Syrian help in
  preventing a total Arab breach with Tehran.
      Further escalation of the war threatening the Gulf Arab
  states could work against Tehran at the Amman gathering, they
  said.
      ""The ball is in Iran's court now. It's up to Tehran to
  respond one way or the other,"" a diplomat said.
      President Ronald Reagan warned Iran of stronger American
  countermeasures if the military escalation continued.
      Western diplomats and military sources in the area said
  shelling the platform appeared to be the least provocative act
  the United States could have taken once it had decided to
  retaliate for the tanker attack, blamed by both the Americans
  and Kuwaitis on Iran.
      ""It's interesting that they chose something in international
  waters because it doesn't implicate any other nation,"" one
  diplomat said. ""This was better for U.S. Relations with the Gulf
  Arab states, particularly Kuwait.""
      Commented another diplomat: ""Kuwait must be happy that the
  U.S. Has done something, but relieved that Faw was not attacked
  on its doorstep.""
      One source said of the attack on the oil platform: ""They
  managed to warn off the crew and hit something that was the
  least nuisance to everybody.""
      A diplomat commented: ""They were very clever in the place
  they chose. It gets attention, but it hasn't devastated
  anything because it wasn't working in the first place.""
      A senior Arab banker in the area said after the news broke:
  ""This was a good, measured response without risking a flare-up
  ... It is a face-saving response (for the Americans).""

test/18050,"LAWSON CALLS INTERVENTION PROOF OF STABILITY GOAL
  The scale of foreign exchange intervention
  the Bank of England has carried out recently is clear proof of
  Britain's determination to stabilise exchange rates as agreed
  between the Group of Seven industrialised countries in Paris in
  February, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.
      Saying he was ""content"" with sterling's current value, Lawson
  told reporters he wanted ""to maintain the exchange rate
  stability we have all signed up for."" He declined to say if he
  favoured a rise or a fall from present sterling levels.
   May currency reserves, out today, showed a record 4.8 billion
  stg rise, pointing to massive currency intervention.
      In April, reserves rose a hefty 2.9 billion stg.
      Pointing to the reserves data, Lawson said, ""We have been
  playing a very full part ourselves"" in meeting our commitments
  toward exchange rate stability as agreed in Paris.
      ""We wish to see it (stability) continuing,"" he added.
      Asked which techniques were available to preserve
  stability, Lawson said both central bank intervention and
  interest rate changes could be used to tackle ""the market
  pressures there are from time to time.""
      ""Interest rate stability is not an objective in that
  sense...Rates have to be moved up and down at times,"" he added.
      Lawson said he expected intervention to be ""sterilised"" by
  draining excess sterling liquidity from the market through new
  issues of government securities and foreign currency sales,
  when the market allowed.
      This would limit the inflationary impact of intervention,
  he said.
      ""Sterilisation will be dictated by market tactics...Not
  necessarily in the month in which intervention occurs,"" Lawson
  said. ""I am confident that we can sterilise on this scale.""

  crowns with two domestic yards, the company said in a

      Moss Rosenberg Verft, a subsidiary of Kvaerner Industrier
  A/S &lt;KVIO.OL> won a 1.2 billion crown contract to convert
  Statoil's semisubmersible rig West Vision to a floating
  production platform and to build the deck for a separate, fixed
  well-head platform to be placed on the field, it said.
      Statoil said Aker Verdal, a unit of Aker Norcem A/S
  &lt;AMVO.OL>, won a 300-mln crown contract to design and build the
  well-head platform's 10,000-tonne steel substructure, to stand
  in 150 metres of water next to the converted rig.
      Statoil said using a floating production unit rather than a
  fixed platform would cut construction time, enabling field
  partners to bring Veslefrikk on stream in late 1989 -- several
  months earlier than previously planned.
      Veslefrikk, with estimated recoverable reserves of 258 mln
  barrels oil and 140 billion cubic feet gas, is located 145 km
  west of Bergen.
      Statoil estimates the field's total development cost,
  including drilling, at 6.6 billion crowns. Planned daily output
  is 65,000 barrels oil and 35 mln cubic feet gas.
      Veslefrikk's oil will be landed via the nearby Oseberg
  field pipeline at the Sture crude terminal near Bergen. Its gas
  will be fed into the Statpipe line, which gathers gas from
  Norway's Statfjord, Gullfaks and Oseberg fields.

test/18614,"BUDGET PACT CUTS U.S. FARM FUNDS 1.25 BILLION DLRS
  U.S. House and Senate budget
  negotiators agreed as part of an overall budget accord reached
  yesterday, to cut 1.25 billion dlrs from fiscal 1988 spending
  on agricultural programs, Congressional sources told Reuters.
      The agreed cut in farm programs is a compromise between 1.4
  billion sought by the Senate and one billion by the House.
      The negotiators also agreed to cut 1.6 billion from the
  farm budget in fiscal 1989 and 2.45 billion in 1990, for a
  total of 5.3 billion in saving over three years, sources said.
      The agreement presents the House and Senate Agriculture
  committees with difficult choices on how to make changes in
  agriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targets
  without jeopardizing popular support payments, senior
  Congressional aides told Reuters.
      Some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to find
  the budget savings.
      Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., Chairman of the House grains
  subcommittee, has introduced a bill which would freeze wheat
  and corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrs
  and 1.92 dlrs respectively, saying it would save 500 mln dlrs.
      House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza has
  said the committee will consider the Glickman proposal.
      But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely to
  be approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers and
  a strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who said
  freezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other major
  grain export competitors and would not achieve the budget
  savings Glickman claims.
      Another area where Glickman and other have said budget
  savings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program,
  ARP, levels for wheat and corn.
      However, on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong stand
  within the Reagan administration, arguing that the 1988 crop
  wheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30
  pct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget, OMB. Most
  commodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail.
      Congressional sources said the only way to achieve
  significant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boost
  the 1988 corn ARP. But one informed Congressional source said
  singling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen as
  unfair to one commodity.
      Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is most
  likely to eventually look for budget savings are some
  tightening of the payment limitation rules, and possible 
  adoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains.
      Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billion
  but not enough, they said.
      Ultimately, Congressional sources said the agriculture
  committees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut on
  all Commodity Credit Corp. payments to farmers, including price
  support loans and deficiency payments, similar to the
  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986.

  French industrial gas group &lt;Duffour et
  Igon> has decided to back the takeover bid by Swedish
  industrial gases group Aga AB &lt;AGA.ST>, ending a lengthy battle
  between rival bidders from France, Spain and West Germany,
  Duffour et Igon Chairman Jean Igon said.
      The board agreed late last night to back the Aga bid and
  advise its shareholders to accept the Swedish group's latest
  offer of 4,410 francs per share, he told Reuters.
      The other main bidders were Union Carbide Corp's &lt;UK.>
  French subsidiary &lt;Union Carbide France> and West Germany's
  Linde AG &lt;LING.F>.
      Aga topped rival bids for the gases distribution group in
  May by raising its offer to 4,410 francs from 4,000 francs.
      This was accepted by Spain's &lt;Carburos Metalicos SA> which
  sold Aga six pct of Duffour et Igon's stock and the right of
  first refusal on the remaining nine pct of stock it holds. It
  also won over the French Midi-Pyrenees development authority
  which agreed to sell Aga its 20 pct stake in Duffour et Igon.
      Under Aga's offer, shareholders can either accept a cash
  bid or exchange one share in Duffour et Igon for one bond of a
  nominal value of 4,410 francs with a 10 pct coupon issue by Aga
  France SA. The bond issue is guaranteed by the parent Aga AB.
      The takeover battle for the Toulouse-based company, which
  controls eight pct of the French industrial gas distribution
  market, began on April 2 with an offer of 2,100 francs per
  share from Union Carbide France &lt;UK>.
      Aga's offer, which puts a price of 587 mln francs on the
  company, closes on June 24 and the results will be announced on
  July 21.
      Duffour et Igon shares were quoted yesterday at 4,410
  francs, with no buyers, after a series of suspensions during
  the takeover tussle. They traded at 856 francs on January 9
  before the first suspension.

  Moderately active grain fixing was
  reported out of the U.S. But none of the business involved the
  significant voyages to the Continent or Japan, ship brokers
  said.
      A steady 13.50 dlrs was paid from the U.S. Gulf to Morocco
  and 23.25 dlrs was paid for 27,000 long tons from the Gulf to
  Taiwan. A vessel carrying 13,500 long tons of bagged wheat
  flour from the Gulf to Aqaba received a lump sum of 472,500
  dlrs.
      Grain from the Great Lakes to Algeria made 28 dlrs against
  27.75 paid for similar fixing towards the end of March.
      Market talk suggested a Federal Commerce vessel had been
  booked to move grain from the Great Lakes to Morocco on Comanav
  account at about 22 dlrs and 15.50 had been paid for a cargo of
  oilseeds from British Columbia to Japan, but no confirmation
  was obtainable.
      On the Continent, shippers agreed 19 dlrs for wheat from La
  Pallice to Buenaventura and 10.75 dlrs for grain from Ghent to
  Naples/Venice range. Elsewhere, maize from East London to Japan
  paid 22 dlrs.
      Soviet charterers reappeared in the timecharter sector and
  secured a 30,000 tonner from Savona for a trans-Atlantic round
  trip at 4,450 dlrs daily and a 31,000 tonner from
  Antwerp-Hamburg for a similar voyage at 4,250 dlrs daily.

  Hartmarx Corp, following a year of

  1987, Chairman John Meinert told the annual meeting.
      Meinert reiterated an earlier comment that earnings for the
  remainder of the year must double the 1986 level to meet that
  goal. In fiscal 1986, ended November 30, 1986, Hartmarx
  reported earnings of 24.8 mln dlrs, or 1.20 dlrs a share, down
  from the prior year's 42.7 mln dlrs, or 2.25 dlrs a share.
      The 110-year-old apparel manufacturer recently posted
  first-quarter earnings of 54 cts a share, up from 40 cts a year
  ago.
      Meinert told shareholders Hartmarx has no plans to sell any
  of its divisions. He added, ""We have the financial capacity to
  take advantage of acquisitions.""
      In 1987, Meinert said the company will open five new and 10
  redesigned Kuppenheimer direct-to-consumer stores in Atlanta,
  Detroit, St. Louis, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco.
      He said the company's women's apparel continues to grow,
  and Hartmarx has on the drawing board a Briar concept store
  which will feature ties, shirts and some tailored clothing.

  Investor Paul Bilzerian said if Pay N'
  Pak Stores Inc enters into a merger accord with him he will
  immediately begin a tender offer for 7.5 mln shares for 20 dlrs
  per share in cash.
      Bilzerian told Reuters he believes his offer is superior to
  a leveraged buyout proposal disclosed in an announcement by the
  company this morning.
      The company said it is evaluating both proposals.
  Bilizerian said he was optimistic his offer will be accepted at
  a meeting of the board of directors Wednesday. Officials of Pay
  N' Pak did were not immediately available for comment.
   
      Bilzerian said he has a pool of 150 mln dlrs raised by
  Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc available for the tender and ""we
  may add a bank to that.""
      ""We've submitted an agreement we're prepared to sign,"" he
  said. Shares not accepted in Bilzerian's tender would be
  exchangeable for 20 dlrs in convertible preferred stock.
      Asked what would happen if the leveraged buyout group,
  which the company did not identify, topped his offer between
  now and the board meeting, Bilzerian said he expected an
  opportunity to respond.
      Pay N' Pak gave no details about the buyout group, but did
  say the offer was contingent on financing and on an agrreement
  regarding management's equity participation.
      Bilzerian said it was his understanding that the management
  particpation was ""nominal.""
      Pay N' Pak fell 1-1/2 to 19. Arbitrageurs said there was
  disappointment that neither of the offers topped 20 dlrs.
      ""We were expecting an offer north of (above) 21 or 22
  dlrs,"" said one arbitrageur. The leveraged buyout plan was for
  17.50 dlrs per share in cash and 2.50 dlrs in 13-1/2 pct
  cumulative preferred stock.
  
      Robert Cheadle, analyst at Montgomery Securities, said ""you
  have to ask yourself why no one in the industry made a bid.""
      Scott Drysdale, analyst at Birr Wilson Securities, said the
  company has not made the best strategic moves over the years.
  ""They have not done the right things at the right time,"" he
  said, and as a result earnings per share have steadily declined
  since 1984. The 57 cts per share in earnings reported for the
  fiscal year ended in February was lower than 1978's earnings,
  he said. Earnings totaled 5.7 mln dlrs on revenue of 398.4 mln
  dlrs.
      Drysdale said Pay N' Pak has better trained sales people
  than many competitors, but it competes on price even though
  competitors have lower costs. The result is squeezed margins.
  He noted that there have been no other publicly identified
  bidders stepping forward since the company rejected an earlier
  Bilzerian proposal in mid-April.
      Another arbitrageur said it might not be too late for
  another bidder to get in the game. He speculated that someone
  in the same home improvement business might be able to offer a
  deal for stock that would top both the buyout proposal and
  Bilzerian's plan.

test/21486,"SAUDI TO REMAIN AS KEY LPG SUPPLIER TO JAPAN
  Saudi Arabia is likely to remain the key
  supplier of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to Japan for at least
  the next five years, oil industry sources said.
      Japan, while diversifying its supply sources of propane and
  butane for stable supplies, will continue to bank on Saudi
  Arabian LPG, the sources said.
      They said Saudi's supply capabilities of LPG, an associate
  of crude oil, is guaranteed by its crude output capacity. ""Saudi
  is a reliable supplier in that sense,"" said one trader.
      Japan imports about 50 pct of its LPG from Saudi Arabia.
      No single nation could substitute for Saudi Arabia as an
  LPG supply source to Japan, the sources said.
      ""Saudi Arabia has committed itself to Japanese LPG buyers,
  which has quelled fears that LPG supplies from the Mideast Gulf
  could easily be disrupted in the wake of heightened hostilities
  in that area,"" said another trader.
      Saudi Arabia cut LPG shipments to Japan and elsewhere by 20
  pct in September after a fire put a major gas plant at
  Al-Juaimah out of operation. October shipments were back to
  contractual volumes as Saudi was able to boost exports from
  other ports.
      Attacks on Gulf shipping by Iran and Iraq centered on crude
  rather than products carriers, which has lulled fears of LPG
  supply disruptions, traders said.
      They said an Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz was
  unlikely because it would block Iran's oil shipments.
      Industry sources said Japan's LPG imports will not greatly
  rise or fall as its domestic demand growth is estimated at a
  moderate 2.1 pct a year from 1986 through 1991.
      Japanese term buyers of Saudi LPG are expected to lift
  slightly lower volumes from January 1987, when imports from
  Indonesia are slated to increase, the sources said.
      The customers are unlikely to slash Saudi term purchases in
  large scale when Japan increases annual imports of Indonesian
  LPG to 1.95 mln tonnes in early 1989 from 319,000 tonnes in the
  year ended March 1987, the sources said.
      But when demand is sluggish in summer, they will phase down
  term purchases of Saudi LPG and secure lower-priced cargoes on
  the spot market, they said.
      Japan imports some 12 mln tonnes of LPG a year, of which
  5.3 mln tonnes are supplied by Saudi Arabia, 3.3 mln under term
  contracts and two mln through spot purchases. Some 80 pct of
  Japan's LPG imports are from the Middle East.
      Saudi Arabia's state owned oil company Petromin has made
  some concessions on term prices to Japanese customers in the
  recent round of contract renewal talks, and it is likely the
  Japanese will accept the offer, the sources said.
      The Japanese term customers, however, have so far been
  unsuccessful in establishing a transparent price formula to
  replace the existing unilateral monthly price notice.
      Japanese buyers pay Saudi Arabia a price notified by
  Petromin each month. Most recently the FOB price was set at 87
  pct of the 17.52 dlrs per barrel government selling price (GSP)
  of Arabian Light.
      Buyers reserve the right to phase down or out liftings
  should the monthly price be set at over 95 pct of Arabian
  Light's GSP.
      Petromin has offered to lower this rate to 90 pct from the
  95 pct for contracts with Japanese customers from next January,
  the trade sources said.
      Petromin also suggested that a seller's option of supplying
  up to 20 pct more than the contractural volume be subject to
  seller-buyer agreement.
      Under the present contract, Petromin can automatically cut
  supplies up to 10 pct of the contractual volume.
      ""If you want to import LPG from Saudi Arabia on a profitable
  basis, you have to set the price factor at 80 to 85 pct,"" said
  an official at a major importer. ""Freight costs are higher for
  cargoes coming from the Gulf than Southeast Asia due to a
  longer haul and war risk insurance payments.""
      Japanese customers will visit Saudi Arabia this month to
  finalise their separate contract talks, now focusing on
  contractual period and volume, which could be very similar to
  current levels, the sources said. ""When we talk business, we
  would seek profitability and sometimes forget vulnerability of
  high dependence on a single supplier,"" said one.

test/17883,"NO REASON TO CUT RATES - BUNDESBANK'S SCHLESINGER
  Bundesbank vice president Helmut
  Schlesinger said he saw no reason to lower interest rates now.
      With money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down in
  May and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark,
  Schlesinger told Reuters that he was not convinced that a
  further cut in interest rates was needed.
      The economy is picking up, after contracting by a
  seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter from
  the fourth, he added. ""We may have an increase in gnp starting
  in the second quarter,"" he said in an interview.
      Concerned by the first quarter downturn, the U.S. Has been
  pressing West Germany to pump up its economy and boost its
  imports, either through fiscal or monetary policy.
      Schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter was
  mainly due to adverse weather conditions, just as occured in
  1986. Year-on-year growth was thus about two pct.
      He estimated that economic growth for the year as a whole
  would probably be between one and two pct.
     ""It is not a question of monetary conditions if domestic
  demand does not grow strongly,"" he said, noting that interest
  rates are at historically low levels and funds are ample.
      Schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank money
  stock growth was slowing down from its recent year-on-year pace
  of 7-1/2 to eight pct, well above the Bundesbank's three to six
  pct target.
      He said the target could still be achieved but much will
  depend on the direction of long-term capital flows. Heavy
  inflows, particularly in January around the time of the EMS
  revaluation, boosted domestic money supply.
      ""There is still a certain hope that the net inflow of
  foreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bit
  reversed,"" Schlesinger said.
      A major reason for the inflows was the market's conviction
  that the mark was headed higher. ""As we can see from the market,
  expectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark have
  diminished,"" Schlesinger said.
      The recent widening of interest rate differentials, the
  fact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short period
  and an improvement in real trade balances have all combined
  towards stabilizing the dollar, he said.
      Asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollar
  rise, as the U.S. Did in March when the dollar rose above 1.87
  marks, he said this would depend on the circumstances.
      At midday here, the dollar stood at 1.8340/45 marks.
      ""Central banks are always in contact about these
  fluctuations but I cannot give any answer how they would react,""
  Schelsinger said.
      ""One has to look at how it (the market) is moving,"" he said,
  adding, ""It is not only our own case, it is also the American
  case.""
      He said that the West German export industry has been hit
  hard by the dollar's sharp fall and would probably like to see
  some correction now. ""But it wouldn't be good to have short-term
  fluctuations,"" he said. ""Let us wait and see.""
      ""It is mainly the strength of the (dollar) fall in a very
  short period which was a little bit of a shock, than the level
  (of rates) as such,"" Schlesinger said.
      The sharp rise of the mark, coupled with weak prices of
  such key commodities as oil, had a favourable impact on West
  German inflation down year.
      Although there have recently been signs of inflation
  picking up, he said that this was due to changes in key
  commodity prices. The underlying inflation rate this year would
  be unchanged, at about one to 1-1/2 pct, he said.
      Schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growth
  was longer term, in that the economy was building up the
  potential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation.
      The above-target growth of money supply over the past 16
  months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness of
  targets themselves, a matter which might be taken up at the
  mid-year meeting of the Bundesbank's council, Schlesigner said.
      But he added: ""I don't see any great pressure to go away
  from it.""

      The holders, none of whom was willing to be identified,

  dividend, they were unable to determine if it might be better
  for them to continue holding the debentures.
     
      ""There are rumors that various houses will bring litigation

  of Harcourt declined to comment, citing a suit brought by
  British publisher Robert Maxwell whose has been trying to
  acquire Harcourt.
      Executives of First Boston Inc, Harcourt's financial
  adviser, did not return a telephone call seeking comment.

  advised holders of the 6-3/8 pct convertible subordinated
  debentures due 2011 to convert into common by the June eight

      The debentures had been convertible at 34 dlrs per share.
  Harcourt's May 26 announcement said the conversion price would

  With more private investment, not more
  protection, the U.S. textile industry could become competitive
  with the most modern foreign producers, analysts from two
  congressional agencies said today.
      The Office of Technology Assessment, a nonpartisan arm of
  Congress told a House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee hearing
  there was still concern for the future of parts of the U.S.
  textile and apparel industry, but there was more reason for
  optimism than a few years ago.
      ""While textile producers are making significant
  investments, they could do more,"" OTA analyst Henry Kelly said.
      The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the nonpartisan
  budget analysis arm of Congress, said federal loans or loan
  guarantees would be preferable options for Congress rather than
  increased trade protection which could lead to foreign
  retaliation.
      CBO analyst Edward Gramlich said past trade protections,
  first imposed in the 1950's have had only a small benefit for
  profits and investments of domestic firms.
      Trade Subcommittee chairman, Rep. Sam Gibbons, said the
  agencies analyses seemed to agree with his opinion against
  congressional approval of protectionist textile quota
  legislation aimed mainly at Western Europe, Japan and other
  Asian textile producing countries.
      President Reagan last year vetoed a textile protection bill
  but it was reintroduced in this session of Congress and is
  expected to be voted on in the House this year.
      However, approval this year is in doubt because passage of
  a major trade bill without specific protections for textiles
  showed a weakening of support for the legislation.
      Most U.S. producers have fallen behind other foreign
  producers in the use of modern textile and apparel production
  equipment and net imports are growing faster than the domestic
  markets, Kelly said.
      He added that private investment in the textile and
  clothing industry in 1983 of 0.5 pct was less than one-seventh
  the average manufacturing investment of 3.9 pct.
      Despite existing import quotas and tariffs, imports of
  textiles grew 26 pct in 1986 and imports of apparel grew 14 pct
  while U.S. production rose only 1.9 pct.
      ""The traditional industry seems destined to be replaced by
  new technology, imports, or some combination of both. While the
  industry may not be able to compete in all domestic markets
  that it enjoyed twenty years ago, the results of our research
  indicate that portions of the domestic market can be recovered,
  and that exports can be expanded,"" Kelly said.

      In the 1986 annual repoprt, he said lengthy negotiations

  through Reuter services.
      ""Many other markets maintain restrictions,"" he added.

      In other cases, exchanges seem to be limiting the

  to their own commercial information businesses.
      He also noted that despite increasing liberalisation in the
  telecommunications field, some countries continue to protect
  their state monopolies at the expense of other economic
  sectors.
      ""Reuter dealing services remain excluded from such

test/16112,"TEXACO SEES BUSINESS LITTLE HIT BY BANKRUPTCY MOVE
  Texaco Inc &lt;TX> said its decision to
  file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
  code will not affect the majority of its businesses.
      It said its subsidiaries, which account for 96 pct of its
  32.6 billion dlrs in revenues and 79 pct of its net property,
  plant and equipment, were free of the action.
      Only parent holding company, Texaco Inc, and operating
  subsidiaries, Texaco Capital Inc and Texaco Capital N.V, are
  affected, it said.
      But the company said it was likely to suspend its 75 cents
  per share quarterly common stock dividend and halt repayments
  on debts of some 6.8 billion dlrs.
      Texaco said it filed for Chaper 11 because suppliers were
  demanding cash payments and banks were withholding loans as a
  result of a legal dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL>.
      Texaco is fighting a Texas law requiring it to post a bond
  of more than 10 billion dlrs before it can appeal a 1985
  judgment that ruled it illegally interfered with Pennzoil's
  1984 acquisition of Getty Petroleum Corp &lt;GTY>. The bond almost
  matches the damages awarded against Texaco.
      Should Texaco fail to place the bond, Pennzoil could begin
  to attach its assets to secure the judgment.
      Last Monday, the Supreme Court overturned a decision to cut
  Texaco's bond to one billion dlrs, and sent the issue back to
  the Texas courts.
      Analysts said the bankruptcy filing effectively froze all
  Texaco's obligations while it continued to appeal the merits of
  the Pennzoil lawsuit.
      ""Attempts last week to win a compromise on both the bond
  issue and the larger dispute failed,"" James Kinnear, Texaco's
  president and chief executive officer, told reporters.
      Kinnear said Pennzoil's disclosure in court papers on
  Friday that it wanted to extend the bond issue hearing until
  the end of April, pushed Texaco further towards Chapter 11.
      Pennzoil had asked Texaco to post a 5.6 billion dlr cash
  bond and to reduce its dividend to not more than 50 pct of
  earnings. Pennzoil also wanted assurances that Texaco would not
  sell any assets, Kinnear said.
      Texaco offered to put up one billion dlrs in a letter of
  credit and agreed not to let the value of its assets fall under
  11.1 billion dlrs, he added.
      Joseph Jamail, a Houston attorney for Pennzoil, said the
  company had made its latest settlement offer to Texaco on
  Saturday and was taken by surprise when Texaco filed for
  bankruptcy.
      He declined to reveal the amount of the proposal, citing a
  confidentiality agreement between the two companies. ""Texaco
  told us they would get back to us but instead they chose to go
  to bankruptcy court,"" Jamail said.
      Attorneys for Pennzoil said they believed the company would
  prevail in court appeals, adding that Texaco's assets were
  ample ultimately to pay the Pennzoil judgment in full.

  Dutch insurer AEGON NV &lt;AEGN.AS>
  reported a 6.4 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 327.1 mln
  guilders and said it expected a moderate increase in profits
  for 1987.
      Total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billion
  guilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985. The company said its
  revenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and a
  change in accounting practice. It added that revenues would
  have risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred.
      Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainly
  due to its life insurance business.
      Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rose
  despite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums and
  higher personal risks.
      Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damage
  insurances. AEGON did not specify the loss.
      In the United States, revenue in guilders from health and
  life insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a change
  in accounting for U.S. Annuities.
      AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personal
  investment influences that it should be accounted differently
  from the more traditional insurances.
      This change in accounting practice and another change to
  account for profits made on fixed interest investments,
  resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mln
  guilders.
      AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profits
  were slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initial
  costs for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in The
  Hague.
      In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emerged
  in the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initial
  costs for these products have depressed net profits somewhat.
      Monumental Corp, a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON in
  May 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by these
  costs and made only a small contribution to the group's
  profits.
      AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwill
  for Monumental Corp.
      AEGON's net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in December
  1986, against 3.46 billion the year before.

  U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
  has asked Japan to open its farm market further to help
  Washington cut its trade deficit and ease protectionist

      Hideo Maki, Director General of the ministry's Economic
  Affairs Bureau, quoted Lyng as telling Agriculture Minister
  Mutsuki Kato that the removal of import restrictions would help
  Japan as well as the United States.
      The meeting with Kato opened a 12-day visit to Japan by

      However, Maki quoted Kato as replying that Japan was
  already the world's largest grain importer.
      Kato added Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Grain and
  depended on domestic output for only 53 pct of its food
  requirements in 1985.
      Lyng said the U.S. Put high priority on talks on 12 farm
  products named in U.S. Complaints against Japan to the General
  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) last year, as well as on
  beef, citrus products and rice.
      Kato said Japan will maintain its current level of
  self-sufficiency and will try not to produce surplus rice
  because potential production is higher than domestic demand.
      The world farm market suffers from surpluses because of
  rising production by exporting countries, he added.
      Lyng said the U.S. Has been trying to reduce farm product
  output with expensive programs, Maki said.
      Maki said the U.S. And Japan will hold detailed discussions

  The leaders of a U.S. Senate team probing
  American defense strategy in the MidEast Gulf said they favored
  a multinational force to keep oil flowing through the waterway.
      Sen. John Glenn and John Warner, in Kuwait as part of a
  Gulf Arab tour, said at a news conference that top officials in
  the area appeared ready to discuss extra facilities needed if
  the U.S. upgraded its defense role.
      The Senate team next heads for the United Arab Emirates,
  their last stop on a fact-finding mission prompted by Reagan
  administration plans to let half of Kuwait's 22-tanker fleet
  fly the U.S. flag.
      Glenn and Warner said the U.S., Britain and France, should
  explore the possibility of a unified Gulf force.
      ""The American ships, the British ships, the French ships now
  talk to each other and all we've got to do is formalize this
  arrangement,"" Warner said.
      Glenn said a multinational force could be effectively
  deployed within 24 hours of a decision.
      Glenn voiced a preference for a United Nations
  multinational force, or failing that, an American, British,
  French force with cooperation from the Gulf Arab states.
      Warner voiced concern that the Soviet Union might use the
  situation in the Gulf to raise its presence. ""And,
  unequivocally, all GCC states we have talked with, have said
  that would not be in the interests of the Arabian peninsula.""

  The Federal Reserve Board said it
  approved Citicorp's application to purchase through its

  Calif.
      Citicorp Savings proposed to assume two billion dlrs in

      The proposal involved less than one third of the assets and

      The Fed said that it generally has determined there were
  potentially adverse effects of allowing affiliations of banks
  and savings and loan associations, although it has allowed bank
  holding companies to acquire some failing thrifts.
      It said Citicorp's proposal ""properly may be viewed as the

      Citicorp Savings, the successor to the failed Fidelity
  Savings and Loan Association, has assets of 4.9 billion dlrs

  Amoco Corp is apparently the successful
  bidder for debt-laden Dome Petroleum Ltd, according to a
  published report.
      The Toronto Globe and Mail, quoting sources close to the
  negotiations, today said Dome broke off talks last night with
  TransCanada PipeLines Ltd, which last week announced a 4.3
  billion Canadian dlr offer for all of Dome's assets.
      No financial details about the Amoco offer were available
  and a Dome spokesman would neither confirm nor deny that Amoco
  had emerged the winner, the newspaper said.
      However, the Dome spokesman indicated that the sale of Dome
  could be finalized and announced this weekend, the Globe and
  Mail said.
      Representatives of Amoco were not immediately available for
  comment.
      Last Sunday, when TransCanada announced its offer, Dome
  said it was also in talks with two other companies, but refused
  to identify them.
      Since then, market speculation has centered on Amoco and
  Exxon Corp's &lt;XON> 70 pct-owned Imperial Oil Ltd subsidiary in
  Canada.
      British Petroleum PLC &lt;BP> and Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD>
  have also been mentioned as possible suitors for Dome.
      In the past two days, Dome management has been pressured by
  the federal government to select the offer from TransCanada,
  the only Canadian company in the bidding.
      Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government appears to want
  to avoid a Dome sale to a foreign company since the government
  gave Dome hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks to
  encourage oil and gas exploration in the Arctic, analysts and
  officials have said.
      A purchase by TransCanada would be least likely to run
  afoul of Canadian antitrust laws, however, TransCanada is
  asking for tax concessions from a federal government that is
  trying to hold its deficit below 30 billion Canadian dlrs,
  analysts have said.
      A takeover by Amoco or Imperial would also give a foreign
  oil company a dominant position in Canada's oil industry.
      Imperial Oil is already Canada's largest energy company,
  with 1986 revenues of 7.1 billion Canadian dlrs. Chicago-based
  Amoco had 1986 revenues of 20.23 billion U.S. dlrs. Its Amoco
  Canada Petroleum subsidiary is 100 pct owned by Amoco Corp.

  Britain's Defence Minister George Younger
  said the U.S. Was unfairly protecting its defence industry, and
  this could lead to British firms demanding counter-measures.
      Younger told a U.S. Chamber of Commerce meeting that U.S.
  Legislators were failing to realise ""the true nature of the
  two-way street in terms of ideas, technology and equipment.
      A British parliamentary report said that up to March
  British firms had been awarded just 34 mln dlrs worth of
  contracts for the Strategic Defence Initiative, compared with
  the 1.5 billion dlrs Britain had hoped to secure.
      The committee said U.S. Technology export restrictions and
  ""selectiveness"" towards foreign contractors had denied British
  competitors more lucrative orders and largely excluded them
  from technological research for SDI.
      Younger said London had given U.S. Companies contracts
  under conditions of fair and open competition. ""All we ask is
  for our companies to be given similar opportunities,"" he added.
      If new American legislation aimed at curbing unfair
  subsidies was used to exclude foreign suppliers it would not be
  surprising if British firms pressed for retaliatory measures,
  Younger said.

  The United States invoked the right

  Gulf, the American delegation told the United Nations.
      Lieutenant General Vernon Walters sent letters about the
  incident to Security Council President Maurizio Bucci, the
  delegate of Italy, and Secretary General Javier Perez de
  Cuellar.
      U.N. press secretary Francois Giuliani said the Secretary
  General had no comment on the attack, which followed his appeal
  last Friday for restraint in the crisis while he pursued
  efforts to obtain a ceasefire between Iran and Iraq.
      In his explanation, Walters said the United States took
  defensive action in response to an Iranian attack against
  American ships in the Gulf.
      He cited an Iranian Silkworm missile strike last Friday in
  Kuwait waters against the United States-flag ship Sea Isle
  City.
      Walters said that military forces on the destroyed Iranian
  platform had engaged in a variety of actions against United
  States-flag and other nonbelligerent vessels and planes.
      ""In accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations
  (Charter), I wish, on behalf of my government, to report that
  United States forces have exercised the inherent right of
  self-defense under internation law by taking defensive action
  in response to attacks by . . . Iran against United States
  vessels in the Gulf,"" Walters said.
      Members of the Security Council met behind closed doors on
  Monday to discuss developments in the Gulf war, but no
  statement was issued afterwards.

  President Reagan called for continued
  nondiscriminatory treatment for Romanian exports to the United
  States in the face of congressional opposition because of the
  Bucharest government's record on human rights.
      A White House statement said Reagan's decision to press for
  continuation of so-called Most Favored Nation (MFN) status for
  Romania had been ""exceptionally difficult"" and came after ""all
  options were seriously considered.""
      But the statement said that despite concerns about human
  rights abuses by the Bucharest government, the president had
  decided that should be continued because it helped stimulate
  emigration from Romania and gave the United States influence on
  human rights practices there.
      The statement was issued as Reagan sent to Congress
  requests for one-year extensions of MFN for Romania, Hungary
  and China.
      The House of Representatives has attached to a trade bill
  legislation that would temporarily deny MFN for Romania pending
  certification by Reagan that the country had made progress on
  human rights. There is no controversy over continuation of MFN
  for Hungary and China.

test/18252,"HOLLLINGER &lt;HLG.TO> PAYING 50 MLN DLRS FOR BUY
  Hollinger Inc will pay about 50 mln dlrs
  cash for its previously reported acquisition of privately owned
  Unimedia Inc, chairman Conrad Black told reporters after the
  annual meeting, confirming a published report.
      Commenting on press reports about the 50 mln dlr price tag,
  Black said, ""That would not be wildly inaccurate,"" although he
  declined to disclose the actual cost.
      Montreal-based Unimedia is Quebec's third largest newspaper
  group, with three French language daily newspapers in Quebec
  City, Ottawa and Chicoutimi, Quebec and four printing plants in
  Ontario and Quebec.
      Black added that Hollinger would also continue seeking
  acquisitions of daily newspapers with circulation under 25,000
  readers. He said Hollinger was currently talking to about 10
  such newspapers in the U.S. where the company currently owns 23
  dailies.
      ""There is really no end to the ones that are available,"" he
  told reporters, although he added that most remaining
  acquisition opportunities are in the U.S.
      He said that Hollinger's 58 pct-owned Daily Telegraph PLC,
  of London, should become profitable in this year's fourth
  quarter.
     
      For full-year 1987, the Daily Telegraph could break even or
  better, said Black, citing major reductions in labor costs and
  improved technology at the Telegraph, Britain's largest
  circulation quality daily. The Telegraph lost 13.2 mln Canadian
  dlrs last year.
      Daily Telegraph chief executive Andrew Knight told
  reporters after the meeting that the Telegraph's daily
  circulation had risen by 25,000 since September to about
  1,150,000 on weekdays, despite added competition from the new
  Independent daily newspaper.
     
      Knight said The Independent was not affecting the
  Telegraph's growth, but was making inroads into the circulation
  of other London quality dailies such as The Times and The
  Guardian.
      Hollinger chairman Black predicted Hollinger would post
  1987 net income of about 55 mln dlrs, or one dlr a share,
  including extraordinary gains from previous sales of
  discontinued operations. Hollinger lost 87 mln dlrs or 6.54
  dlrs a share last year on fewer average shares and after an
  extraordinary loss of 52 mln dlrs.
     
      Black told shareholders that first quarter operating
  earnings on continuing operations amounted to 499,000 dlrs
  against a year-ago loss of 165,000 dlrs.
      Revenues on continuing operations rose to 102.1 mln dlrs
  from 1.5 mln dlrs last year, which did not include Daily
  Telegraph revenues, he added. Consolidated first quarter
  figures were not disclosed.
      He said the Daily Telegraph's first quarter operating loss
  was sharply reduced from last year.

  Gencorp Inc and Continental AG of

      Under the agreement the companies said Continental will
  acquire General Tire, including its related domestic and
  foreign operations, and Gencorp will retain liability for the
  medical benefits of retired General Tire employees who retired
  on or before November 30, 1984.
      The sale is expected to be completed on or before November
  one and is subject to meeting certain conditions.
      Continental is Europe's second largest tire producer. Last
  year, the company had sales of 2.6 billion dlrs, with 1.9
  billion dlrs generated by its tire operations.
      Last year, General Tire had operating profits of 79 mln
  dlrs on sales of 1.1 billion dlrs, and Gencorp had operating
  profits of 130 mln dlrs on sales of 3.1 billion dlrs.
      GenCorp spokesman Rip Tilden said the company will retain
  about 100 mln dlrs in liability for its former General Tire
  employees under the agreement.
      Tilden said Gencorp will use the proceeds from the sale to
  reduce its 1.5 billion dlr debt.
      In April, GenCorp sucessfully thwarted a takeover by a
  partnership formed by AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG> and Wagner and
  Brown with a restructuring program that included the purchase
  of up to 54 pct, or 12.5 mln shares, of its common at 130 dlrs
  a share for a total of 1.6 billion dlrs
      As part of the restructuring, GenCorp also said it planned
  to sell its tire business, the bottling operations of its RKO
  General Inc subsidiary, and RKO's remaining broadcast
  properties to focus on the company's aerospace and automotive
  components businesses.
     
      Tilden said Gencorp expects to realize about 850 mln dlrs
  in after tax proceeds by the end of 1987 as a result of sale of
  several pieces of the nonbroadcast assets of the company,
  including general tire.
      ""The price paid for General tire would not cause us to
  reevaluate that estimate,"" said Tilden.
      General Tire employs 10,000 people worldwide and has four
  tire manufacturing plants in the U.S. and one in Canada.
      In a statemnet, A. William Reynolds, GenCorp chairman said
  the sale of General Tire ""represents a critical accomplishment
  in our plan to restructure GenCorp.""
     
      Reynolds also said GenCorp's previously announced sale of
  its other businesses are ""proceeding satisfactorily.""
      Among the pieces of Gencorp's empire that remain to be sold
  are its RKO bottling operations. GenCorp agreed to sell RKO's
  KHJ-TV station to Walt Disney Co &lt;DIS> for
  217 mln dlrs. That deal awaits approval by the Federal
  Communications Commission. GenCorp also received 257 dlrs after
  tax from the sale of RKO's WOR-TV.

  The Kuwait Central Bank kept its window
  for funds to the domestic interbank deposit market shut as
  banks returned from a four day holiday, dealers said.
      The move drove short-term interest rates sharply higher,
  with overnight and tomorrow-next funds more than doubling from
  last Wednesday and hitting 20 pct.
      There were few offers in a tight market and traders
  scrambled for any available funds. One-month to one-year
  deposits were indicated one point higher at eight, seven pct
  but there was little activity at the longer end of the market.
      Bankers see the suspension of central bank aid as a
  deliberate move to drive up Kuwaiti dinar interest rates and
  stem a flow of funds out of the country, where market
  nervousness is increasing over the growing tension in the Gulf.
      The central bank's move has been combined with a steady cut
  in the dinar exchange rate.
      Today's rate was reduced to 0.27939/73 to the dollar from

test/19040,"TAIWAN DOLLAR AND RESERVES SEEN RISING MORE SLOWLY
  Recent government moves to curb capital
  inflow have temporarily helped to slow the rise of Taiwan's
  foreign exchange reserves and to stabilise the local dollar
  against the U.S. Currency, officials and bankers said.
      Central bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters the
  reserves rose only about 500 mln U.S. Dlrs in the past two
  weeks and the local dollar appreciated more slowly against the
  U.S. Dollar.
      Chang said, ""The pace of increase in our reserves is much
  slower now than before and our currency is getting more stable.""
  He said the reserves, mainly the result of the trade surplus
  with the U.S., Rose at the rate of two to three billion U.S.
  Dlrs a month between January and May.
      The reserves, the world's third largest after Japan and
  West Germany, now total well over 60 billion U.S. Dlrs.
      On June 2 the central bank froze overseas borrowings of
  local and foreign banks and cut the limit on central bank
  purchases of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40 pct from 90
  pct of the value of a contract.
      Local and foreign bankers said the June 2 measures had
  drastically limited their ability to lend foreign exchange to
  importers and exporters.
      They said their overseas borrowings and forward dollar
  transactions showed a drastic decline with some banks
  registering a fall of up to 30 pct.
      Bank dealers said the Taiwan dollar has stabilised against
  the U.S. Currency this week after rising two to five Taiwanese
  cents a day between June 2 and 13 compared with a rise of five
  to eight cents in May.
      The bank dealers said the central bank, which had
  previously bought U.S. Dollars heavily, sold at least 1.1
  billion U.S. Dlrs in the past two weeks to meet commercial
  demand.
      They said they expected the government to keep the local
  dollar stable in the near term to give breathing space to
  businesses experiencing slower exports because of the rise of
  more than 23 pct in the value of the Taiwan dollar since
  September 1985.
      The Taiwan dollar opened at 31.09 to the U.S. Dollar today,
  unchanged from yesterday.
      Keh Fei-Lo, vice president of First Commercial Bank, said,
  ""It appears the central bank's move to curb the capital inflow
  is quite successful.""
      Vice economic minister Wang Chien-Shien said the slower
  rise in foreign exchange reserves would help ease pressure from
  Washington over the large U.S. Trade deficit with Taiwan.
      Over the past year Taiwanese businessmen have delayed
  imports of machinery and production equipment because of
  exchange rate uncertainty, he said. The stable exchange rate
  would help boost imports, particularly from the United States.

  Brazil's September trade surplus

  compared with 1.434 billion dlrs in August and 540 mln dlrs in
  September last year, Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade Department
  (Cacex) director Namir Salek said in a news conference.
      September exports were 2.694 billion dlrs, slightly down
  from 2.76 billion dlrs in August. Imports in September amounted
  to 1.2 billion dlrs, against 1.32 billion dlrs in August.
      Salek said the accumulated surplus in the Jan-Sept period
  was 7.857 billion dlrs, compared with 8.667 billion dlrs in a
  similar 1986 period.
      Coffee accounted with 320 mln dlrs of exports, up from 222
  mln dlrs in August and 212 mln in September 1986, Salek said.
      The Cacex director said he expected the country's trade

  of the year, estimating the year's overall surplus to reach
  10.2 billion dlrs, from 25.6 billion dlrs worth of exports and
  15.4 billion dlrs of imports.
      He attributed the good surplus on exports of manufactured
  and semimanufactured goods. He mentioned car exports, which
  accounted alone with sales of 617 mln dlrs in the Jan-Sept
  period, against 194 mln dlrs in a similar 1986 period.

test/16190,"CURRENCY MOVES MAY BE HURTING WORLD TRADE
  Japanese trade figures are seriously
  challenging the entrenched view of policy makers of the Group
  of Seven industrialised nations that relative currency rates
  are the key to smoothing world trade problems.
      Senior Japanese, U.S. And European officials in Tokyo say
  they are at a loss to fully explain the data, for if currencies
  are the key they ask, why then are are U.S. Exports to Japan
  shrinking?
      What if manipulating currencies and driving the dollar down
  made world trade problems worse rather than solving them,
  fulfilling Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker's forecast of
  world trade recession?
      U.S.-Japan trade has declined even after a 40 pct dollar
  fall against the yen since the September 1985 Group of Five
  pact in New York.
      The lower dollar ought to have made U.S. Exports 40 pct
  more competitive in Japan. The officials, most of them
  economists, can offer no objective reason why they are not.
      Worse, how are European Community sales to Japan rising
  rapidly when the European Currency Unit has until now declined
  only 11 pct against the yen.?
      Last week's G-7 meeting in Washington has been widely
  interpreted as a sign from the policy makers that the dollar
  must go lower. So worst of all, what if Volcker is correct?
      At a loss to give an objective explanation, officials can
  only offer explanations which tend to be highly subjective.
      ""I don't know and I don't think anyone knows,"" said Hugh
  Richardson, acting head of the EC delegation in Tokyo.
      ""What I do know is that Community exporters are making a
  hell of an effort in this market. If you make an effort, there
  is money to be made in Japan,"" he added.
      But U.S. Officials and businessmen are convinced low U.S.
  Exports to Japan are Japan's fault. They cite restrictive trade
  practices, protected Japanese trade sectors, such as
  agriculture, and non-tariff barriers, such as unreasonable
  checking and customs procedures for car imports.
      Publicly, Japanese officials remain conciliatory in the
  face of what they see as U.S. Aggression. In private, they
  blame U.S. Industry for being uncompetitive.
      ""We see it that way, but we don't like to seem arrogant,""
  said a senior official, who declined to be named. ""We like to
  refrain from accusing them of not making enough effort.""
      Industrialists such as Eishiro Saito, chairman of the
  Keidanren business group, and Sony Corp chairman Akio Morita
  repeatedly accuse foreign firms of not making enough effort to
  understand Japan's markets, and some foreigners agree. ""The real
  issue is the inability of major sectors of American and
  European industry to compete not only internationally but even
  in their home markets,"" Peter Huggler, President of Interallianz
  Bank Zurich, told a recent conference in Switzerland.

  The U.S. Agriculture Department has

      USDA reduced the price of hard red winter wheat at Kansas
  City and Texas by six cents, at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32
  cents and at St Louis by nine cents, Ralph Klopfenstein, deputy
  administrator of commodity operations at the Agricultural
  Stabilization and Conservation Service, said.
      The department also lowered the terminal price of hard red
  spring wheat at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32 cents, he said.
      In addition, USDA cut the Pacific Northwest price of hard
  red spring wheat by 31 cents, USDA officials who asked not to
  be identified said.
      The officials said hard red spring wheat prices at Chicago,
  Denver and Toledo were adjusted by about the same amount as at
  Pacific Northwest, Duluth and Minneapolis.
      The price changes should lead to a pickup of PIK and roll
  activity, Klopfenstein said. The price change was decided upon
  last week and will be effective today, he said.
      Klopfenstein also said the department raised the premiums
  on high protein wheat to offset the drop in low protein wheat
  prices, meaning the net price on any wheat commanding a protein
  premium would remain unchanged.

  Tokyo's foreign exchange market is watching
  nervously to see if the U.S. Dollar will drop below the
  significant 140.00 yen level, dealers said.
      ""The 140 yen level is key for the dollar because it is
  considered to be the lower end of the reference range. If the
  currency breaks through this level, it may decline sharply,""
  said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant general manager at Dai-ichi
  Kangyo Bank Ltd's international treasury division.
      The dollar was at 141.10 yen at midday against Friday
  closes of 142.35/45 in New York and 141.35 here.
      The dollar opened at 140.95 yen and fell to a low of
  140.40. It was 1.7733/38 marks against 1.7975/85 in New York
  and 1.8008/13 here on Friday, after an opening 1.7700/10.
      The currency's decline was due to remarks on Sunday by U.S.
  Treasury Secretary James Baker, dealers said.
      ""The dollar fell over the weekend on increased bearish
  sentiment after Baker's comments,"" said Dai-ichi's Tanaka. He
  said this stemmed from mounting concern that cooperation among
  the group of seven (G-7) industrial nations to implement the
  Louvre accord to stabilise currencies might be fraying.
      The dollar's fall was also prompted by a record one-day
  drop in the Dow Jones industrial average on Friday and weakness
  in U.S. Bond prices, dealers said.
      Baker said the Louvre accord was still operative but he
  strongly criticised West German moves to raise key interest
  rates. Operators took Baker's comment to indicate impatience
  with some G-7 members for failing to stick to the Louvre accord
  due to their fears of increasing inflation.
      Rises in interest rates aimed at dampening inflationary
  pressures also slow domestic demand.
      West Germany and Japan had both pledged at G-7 meetings to
  boost domestic demand to help narrow the huge U.S. Trade
  deficit, Tanaka said.
      U.S. August trade data showed the U.S. Deficit at a still
  massive 15.68 billion dlrs. But if West Germany raises interest
  rates, this would run counter to the pledge, he said.
      ""Operators are now waiting to see if the G-7 nations
  coordinate dollar buying intervention,"" said Soichi Hirabayashi,
  deputy general manager of Fuju Bank Ltd's foreign exchange
  department.
      The target range set by the Louvre accord is generally
  considered to be 140.00 to 160.00 yen, dealers said.
      ""The market is likely to try the 140 yen level in the near
  future and at that time, if operators see the G-7 nations
  failing to coordinate intervention, they would see the Louvre
  accord as abandoned and push the dollar down aggressively,""
  Hirabayashi said. He said the U.S. Currency could fall as low
  as 135 yen soon.

test/18672,"U.K. DATA DEPRESS RATE CUT OUTLOOK - ANALYSTS
  Today's U.K. Economic data have pushed
  the chances of another base lending rate cut from the current
  nine pct further into the distance, analysts said.
      A record fall in unemployment and good manufacturing
  production data showed that the economy is still strong and
  does not need a fillip from lower rates.
      News that underlying earnings are rising 7.75 pct annually,
  taken together with higher than expected bank lending and money
  supply growth, revived inflation worries and monetarist
  arguments against easier credit, they said.
      ""The timetable on lower interest rates is being pushed back
  all the while. The strength of the economy and broad money
  growth are making it more difficult to see one in the near
  term,"" said Chase Manhattan Securities economist Robin Marshall.
      Analysts have reached this conclusion despite yesterday's
  mortgage rate cuts for new borrowers, which building societies
  said were a sign of the expected near term trend for U.K.
  Rates.
      It also counters the optimistic forecasts of last week that
  a post-general election cut was imminent, supported by such
  optimistic economic news as May's record reserves rise which
  mirrored the Bank of England efforts to cap sterling's
  strength.
      The gilt market lost nearly half a point as enthusiasm
  about May's 64,300 fall in the seasonally adjusted unemployment
  rate, to 2.95 mln or 10.6 pct of the workforce, was rapidly
  replaced by dismay at the continued high level of underlying
  average earnings in April, dealers said.
      The upset was compounded by news that sterling bank lending
  rose 2.7 billion stg in May, above forecast, and that the Bank
  of England looks likely to have to sell more gilts to offset
  the impact on domestic money supply of its current
  intervention.
      ""The gilt market reaction was correct,"" said Bill Martin,
  chief U.K. Economist at brokers Phillips and Drew.
      ""That's very important ... It shows the economy in a very
  good state indeed,"" Skeoch said.
      ""There's no reason to get worries about inflationary
  pressures because they're very subdued."" Unit wage cost rises
  were better than expected, just one pct higher in the year to
  April, and it was these costs rather than average earnings
  which were potentially inflationary, he added.
      ""I don't think these average earnings numbers are a major
  problem,"" agreed Chase Manhattan's Marshall.
      But he said the gilts market was likely to remain worried
  about the funding implications of recent intervention.
      He said the inflow of foreign money into sterling assets
  earlier this year, attracted by growth prospects and hopes that
  the ruling Conservatives would win last week's election, now
  looks likely to prevent a base rate cut as the authorities try
  to prevent these funds swelling the domestic money system.
      However, David Owen, U.K. Economist at Kleinwort Grieveson
  Securities, said any fresh sterling strength would still
  trigger a base rate cut and that today's figures did not signal
  higher inflation this year.
      ""Wage increases are being offset by productivity growth. As
  long as that continues we're okay,"" he added.

  OPEC re-established the system of fixed price at a level of 18
  dlrs per barrel supported by OPEC production ceilings

  fourth quarter of 1987 will be equal to that of the third
  quarter, I.E. 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd), distributed into
  the same national production levels as were defined by the
  above-mentioned agreement for that quarter.""
      ""Furthermore, the conference decided to establish a
  committee of five heads of delegation to monitor the price
  evolution in the market in relation to the OPEC official prices
  in order to secure price stability around the opec price
  structure.
      ""Should there be any significant change in market prices,
  the committee would immediately call for an extraordinary
  meeting of the conference with a view to deciding on the
  necessary OPEC production levels during the second half of the
  year, which would secure the desired market stability.""
      ""The conference reiterated the necessity of member
  countries' strict adherence to the agreement signed in December
  1986, both in terms of official price, and national production,
  levels.
      ""For this purpose, the conference decided to establish a
  committee of three heads of delegation to undertake visits to
  member countries in order to motivate them to comply with the
  terms of the agreement.""
  
      ""Moreover, the conference stressed the necessity of the
  cooperation of the oil-producing exporting countries outside
  OPEC as an essential prerequisite for a lasting market
  stability.
      The conference, therefore, decided to reinstate the group
  of five heads of delegation established by the 77th

  The United States said Kuwait was
  discussing plans to lease privately-owned U.S. tankers to
  transport oil through the Gulf in addition to putting some of
  its own vessels under American flags.
      State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley, who made the
  disclosure about the tankers, also told reporters the United
  States expects to conclude very soon a favorable arrangement
  with Saudi Arabia concerning expanded security cooperation in
  the Gulf. The two developments occur as the Reagan
  administration continued to come under fire in Congress for its
  plans to bring 11 Kuwaiti tankers under American flags.
      The move is designed to protect the tankers from Iranian
  attacks and ensure freedom of navigation in the strategic
  waterway but has raised fears on Capitol Hill that it will draw
  the United States into the seven-year-old Iran-Iraq War.
      ""The Kuwaitis have discussed the possibility of chartering
  U.S. flag vessels with the Maritime Administration,"" Oakley
  said. She emphasized, however, that ""if some charter arrangement
  could be worked out, it would not supplant the reflagging
  arrangement that we worked out with the Kuwaitis.""
      In both cases, the ships would be eligible for U.S. Navy
  escort in the Gulf, she said.
  
     The Washington Post today quoted John Gaughan, administrator
  of the Martime Administration, as saying Kuwait has approached
  an American shipping company about the possibility of a
  charter.
      Gaughan said that earlier this week he told representatives
  of the company, whose identify he did not know, that chartered
  vessels flying the U.S. flag ""would be protected,"" the newspaper
  reported.
      Concerning Saudi Arabia, Oakley said ""we are moving forward
  in our talks ... on how we can tailor our efforts and security
  cooperation to facilitate our Gulf operations.""

test/14862,"SOUTH KOREA MOVES TO SLOW GROWTH OF TRADE SURPLUS
  South Korea's trade surplus is growing too
  fast and the government has started taking steps to slow it
  down, Deputy Prime Minister Kim Mahn-je said.
      He told a press conference the government planned to
  increase investment, speed up the opening of the local market
  to foreign imports and gradually adjust its currency to hold
  the surplus ""at a proper level.""
      But he said the government would not allow the won to
  appreciate too much in a short period of time. South Korea has
  been under pressure from Washington to revalue the won.
      The U.S. Wants South Korea to cut its trade surplus with
  the U.S., Which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3
  billion dlrs in 1985.
      Kim, who is also economic planning minister, said prospects
  were bright for the South Korean economy, but the government
  would try to hold the current account surplus to around five
  billion dlrs a year for the next five years.
      ""Our government projections of eight pct GNP growth, five
  billion dlrs of (current account) surplus and 12 pct growth in
  exports all seemed to be reasonable early this year. But now
  the surplus is growing faster than we expected,"" he said.
      Trade ministry officials said South Korea's exports rose 35
  pct to 9.34 billion dlrs in the first three months of this
  year, while imports rose only 8.5 pct to 8.2 billion dlrs.
      Kim said the swing of South Korea's current account to a
  surplus of 4.65 billion dlrs in 1986 from an 890 mln dlr
  deficit in 1985 was very significant. The surplus enabled the
  country to reduce its foreign debt last year for the first
  time.
      South Korea's foreign debt, which fell to 44.5 billion dlrs
  in 1986 from 46.8 billion in 1985, is still among the largest
  in Asia.
      ""This huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of the
  major constraints on our development... Last year was a major
  turning point for the Korean economy,"" Kim said.
      Kim said his government plannned to reduce the ratio of
  foreign debt to the country's GNP to about 20 pct in 1991, from
  about 50 pct in 1986.
      ""The government, however, does not want to accelerate
  reducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus,"" he
  said.
      Kim said a sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflation
  and lead to trade friction with Seoul's major trading partners,
  particularly the United States.
      ""We need a surplus because we have to reduce our debt, but
  we are taking measures to hold the size of the surplus at a
  proper level,"" Kim said.

  Enetertainment Marketing Inc and its
  president Elias Zinn have demanded a list of Crazy Eddie Inc
  shareholders from the company and said they may pursue a merger
  of the Edison, N.J. electronics retailer.
      In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
  Zinn said the demand for the shareholder list was made on June
  26 because he may desire to communicate with other Crazy Eddie
  shareholders ""regarding the affairs"" of the company.
      Zinn and his firm, which disclosed they hold a 5.1 pct
  stake in Crazy Eddie common stock, said they may acquire more
  shares through a negotiated merger or tender offer.
      Entertainment Marketing was informed on June 25 by Shearson
  Lehman Brothers Inc., acting on behalf of Crazy Eddie, that it
  would be provided with ""certain information"" about Crazy Eddie,
  it told the SEC.
      Entertainment Marketing, a Houston-based firm involved in
  electronics wholesaling and televised home shopping sales,
  proposed an eight dlr a share merger acquisition of Crazy Eddie
  on May 29, and modified the proposal on June 9 to include the
  possible participation of Crazy Eddie management.
      Entertainment Marketing told the SEC it expects to meet
  with Crazy Eddie representatives in the near future.
      Entertainment Marketing also disclosed that it retained
  Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc as its financial advisor and
  investment banker.
      In light of a June 17 announcement from Crazy Eddie that
  Chemical Bank would no longer fund a 52 mln dlr credit facility
  with the company, plus further declines in the price of its
  stock, Entertainment Marketing and Zinn said they are
  ""continuing to evaluate their alternatives with respect to
  their investment"" in Crazy Eddie stock.
      Depending on its evaluation of the company, including
  actions by Crazy Eddie's board and any possible third party
  bids for the company, Entertainment Marketing and its president
  said they may hold their present stake in the company, sell
  some of their shares, or purchase more shares on the open
  market, through private purchases or in connection with a
  merger or tender offer.
      According to the SEC filing, Entertainment Marketing and
  Zinn bought their current holdings of 1,560,000 Crazy Eddie
  common shares between May 20 and June 17 at 7.42 dlrs to 7.93
  dlrs a share, or a total of about 11.9 mln dlrs.

test/16565,"U.S. BANKS LIKELY TO LIFT PRIME RATES AGAIN SOON
  Major U.S. banks may lift prime
  lending rates again within days due to recent increases in
  their borrowing costs and speculation the Federal Reserve is
  nudging up interest rates to help the dollar, economists said.
      In what was the first prime rate boost since mid-1984, most
  banks in early April lifted their rates a quarter point to
  7-3/4 pct, citing a reduced gap between the prime and their own
  cost of money. That spread has narrowed again.
      ""A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight,""
  said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc.
      Brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct is
  justified because the spread between banks' cost of funds and
  the prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of a
  percentage point.
      He said that spread had averaged around 1.4 percentage
  points since last October until it fell below one point and
  triggered the April prime rate rise at most banks.
      ""We could easily have another prime rate increase as soon
  as this week,"" said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co.
      ""We've got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in the
  near future,"" said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.
      ""Based on the spread between the prime rate and funding
  costs, you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now,""
  said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank.
      However, he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime
  because that would dampen already fairly weak business loan
  demand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintain
  recent upward pressure on money market interest rates.
      Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures lift
  short-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar. He
  said ""if there is widespread belief money market rates will
  stay high, a prime rate rise could occur at any time.""
      Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep a
  dollar drop could help rekindle U.S. inflation. As the dollar
  fell to a 40-year low against the yen Friday, currency traders
  said the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar.
      In addition to buying dollars outright, another way to
  stabilize the U.S. currency would be for the Fed to push U.S.
  interest rates higher relative to overseas rates.
      Based particularly on the Fed's reserve management actions
  on Friday and today, Nathan of Wells Fargo said ""it has become
  clear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure
  in the market. It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed.""
      Bank funding costs and other short and long-term interest
  rates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculation
  that the Fed is gently firming monetary policy.
      That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in the
  market than most economists had expected.
      On Friday, the Fed added reserves indirectly and in small
  amounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements
  with the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another
  high at 6-5/16 pct. With funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pct
  today, the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlr
  round of customer repurchase agreements.
      ""The Fed's actions on Friday and today show that it is
  offering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,""
  said Jones of Lanston.
      ""The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the
  need to defend the dollar,"" Jones said. He believes it is
  merely shading policy toward restraint now, ""but to have a
  major impact on the dollar, the Fed will have to tighten policy
  overtly at some point.""
      Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates by
  becoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and, within
  four to six weeks, to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct.
      Jones said a U.S. discount rate increase to six pct might
  well be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts to
  further aid the dollar.
      Given likely Fed policy firming, he said both the yield on
  30-year Treasury bonds (about 8.30 pct now) and the prime rate
  may be at 8-1/2 pct at end-June and nine pct by year's end.
      ""The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tightening
  policy to defend the dollar,"" said Leslie of Discount Corp. He
  said tax-date pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately.
  Leslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressures
  abate will show whether or not it is firming policy.

  Rep. Mike Synar said today that while
  President Reagan is ready to use military force to protect
  Kuwait tankers in the Gulf, the United States is ill-prepared
  at home to deal with a new energy crisis.
      Synar, Democrat of Oklahoma, made his remarks in comments
  on a study by the General Accounting Office (GAO) on the U.S.
  participation in the 1985 test of the emergency oil sharing
  program of the International Energy Agency.
      The IEA, an alliance of 21 oil consuming countries, was
  formed after the 1973-74 Arab oil embargo to find ways to deal
  with any future oil cutoff.
      Synar said, ""the president is prepared to take military
  action to protect Kuwaiti oil tankers but has been unwilling to
  take less dangerous, equally-important action to prepare our
  nation for the next energy crisis.""
      Reagan said the U.S. military would protect Kuwaiti oilers
  to assure the West of a continuing supply of Middle East oil,
  increasingly being threatened by the Iranian-Iraqi war. Synar,
  who asked for the GAO report after criticism of U.S. action in
  a previous IEA test, said the United States successfully
  advocated a test limited to training participants in oil
  sharing procedures and the system's mechanical aspects.

  India's state-owned Oil and Natural Gas
  Commission (ONGC) plans to drill more wells in the Bombay
  offshore area, where a well spudded in February this year gave
  both oil and gas, an ONGC spokesman said.
      The exploratory well, spudded at a depth of 2,140 metres,
  yielded 2,000 barrels of oil and 180,000 cubic metres of gas
  per day, he said.
      ""The well, one of the four structures drilled in the area 80
  km north-west of Bombay, indicates good prospects of both oil
  and gas. We've decided to drill at least three more wells in
  there before starting production on a commercial scale.""
      Production of Bombay High, part of the Bombay offshore
  field, has stabilised at around 500,000 barrels per day for the
  last two years.
      ONGC produced 27.85 mln tonnes of crude in 1986/87 ending
  March, up from 27.51 the previous year. Bombay High accounted
  for 20.61 mln tonnes, marginally up from 20.10 the year before.
  India's total oil output is around 30 mln tonnes.
      ONGC has been exploring the Bombay offshore area, developed
  since the late 1970s, for more oil as production from Bombay
  High has reached a plateau.

  Bond Corp Holdings Ltd &lt;BONA.S> and Atlas
  Consolidated Mining and Development Corp &lt;ATLC.MN> are still
  holding talks on a bail-out package for the troubled mining
  firm, an Atlas statement said.
      Atlas, the Philippines' biggest copper producer, said it
  had been hit by depressed world copper prices. It reported a
  net loss of 976.38 mln pesos in the year ending December 1986,
  compared with a net loss of 1.53 billion in 1985.
      The company said it had been able to cut its losses because
  its scaled-down copper operations in the central island of Cebu
  started in the second half of 1986.
      Atlas said negotiations were continuing on the acquisition
  by Bond of the company's existing bank loans and their
  restructuring into a gold loan.
      A memorandum of understanding signed by the two sides in
  October last year said Bond would acquire Atlas' total loans of
  275 mln dlrs, to be repaid by the mining company in gold.
      Atlas said the two sides were also discussing equity
  infusion into Atlas and the creation of a development fund for
  further exploration and development of the company's gold
  properties in the central province of Masbate.
      Wilson Banks, general manager of &lt;Bond Corp International
  Ltd> in Hong Kong, told Reuters the Atlas statement on the
  negotiations was ""reasonably accurate.""
      Banks said Bond Corp was seriously considering several
  investments in the Philippines but did not give details.
      In its statement, Atlas said development of the pre-World
  War Two underground mines in Masbate had been accelerated and
  the ore tonnage had increased, extending the operation's life
  at least until 1993.

test/15552,"SPANISH EMPLOYERS WORRIED BY HIGH INTEREST RATES
  The head of Spain's employers'
  federation, Jose Maria Cuevas, said employers were worried
  about the government's monetary policies because high real
  interest rates were hampering investment.
      He told a news conference wage pacts signed so far this
  year were not endangering the government's five pct inflation
  target. The government's perceived need to control inflation by
  keeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said.
      High real interest rates were attracting an influx of
  speculative foreign capital which was undercutting the
  government's target for monetary growth, Cuevas said.
      Spain's most closely-watched measure of money supply,
  liquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17
  pct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and a
  target range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.
      To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call money
  rate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from
  11.8 at end-1986.
      Cuevas said employers were heeding the government's call to
  hold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year,
  with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and new
  wage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.
      These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanish
  workers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.
      He said Spain's current wave of strikes mainly affected the
  state sector, where the government is trying to impose its five
  pct wage ceiling.
      Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend in
  Spain's foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the first
  two months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pct
  increase over the corresponding period last year.
      However, employers did not favour a devaluation of the
  peseta to correct the imbalance.

      Hodel said the loss of some domestic oil production through
  the shutdown of stripper (10 barrels a day or less) wells
  because of low prices was probably permanent. He said he was
  also concerned by the decline in domestic oil exploration.
      Hodel urged Congress to approve oil exploration in section

  geologic condtions in the area were favorable for the discovery
  of oil fields equal to those in nearby Prudhoe Bay.

  resources of more than 9.2 billion barrels, an amount nearly
  equal to the Prudhoe Bay oil field, which currently provides

  International monetary officials will 
  rush to paper over the deep cracks that have appeared in the
  Louvre accord on currency stability to prevent a dollar
  free-fall and to calm turmoil in world capital markets,
  economists and currency traders said.
      ""I don't think the Louvre is dead because if it breaks up
  in an acrimonious way, the potential outcome is a rout of the
  dollar, higher interest rates and collapsing stock markets.
  It's in the Group of Seven's interest to calm things down,""
  said Douglas Madison, corporate trader at BankAmerica Corp.
     
      In a weekend television interview, U.S. Treasury secretary
  James Baker sharply criticised a recent rise in West German
  money market rates and said the eight month-old Louvre pact to
  foster exchange rate stability needs to be reviewed.
      His comments rocked the currency markets and helped send
  the already-fragile U.S. and overseas stock markets into a
  tailspin.
      The dollar lost more than two pfennigs in the U.S. to about

test/15103,"J.P. MORGAN &lt;JPM> NET HURT BY BRAZIL, TRADING
  J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its
  first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its
  previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status
  its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil.
      That decision, spurred by Brazil's suspension of interest
  payments on February 20, reduced the quarter's net income by 20
  mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the
  first three months of 1986.
      Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities
  underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln
  dlrs in the year-earlier period.
      In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading
  losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and
  underwriting of Euromarket securities.
      Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained
  difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering
  heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether
  Morgan's trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket.
      On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan
  losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign
  exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and
  trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln.
      Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and
  commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net
  investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln.
      Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first
  quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell
  to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct.
      If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means
  that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are
  actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9
  mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume
  payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added.
      After the provision for loan losses, Morgan's allowance for
  credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared
  with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier.
      It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after
  charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49
  mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier.
      Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarter's end were
  583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year
  earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from
  303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to
  personnel costs, Morgan said.

  The United States may lift an
  additional 84 mln dlrs in trade sanctions against Japan later
  this month, Reagan Administration officials said.
      President Reagan imposed 300 mln dlrs in sanctions on
  Japanese goods last April for its failure to honor a 1986
  agreement to end dumping semiconductors in the U.S. and third
  country markets and to open its home market to U.S. goods.
      The move raised tariffs to 100 pct from about five pct on
  Japanese color television sets, hand-held power tools and
  portable computers.
      Reagan lifted 51 mln dlrs of the sanctions last June  after
  Japan ended selling the semiconductors on the U.S. market at
  below production costs.
      Semiconductors are the small silicon chips used for memory
  and recall purposes in a wide variety of computers.
      The Administration officials said Commerce Department 
  monitors showed that Japan was ending its dumping of the
  semiconductors in third countries, where they had been taking
  sales away from American-made semiconductors.
      They said it was likely the 51 mln dlrs in sanctions would
  be lifted by the end of the month.
      The United States and Japan remain at odds over opening the
  closed Japanese markets to U.S. goods.
      U.S. and Japanese officials reviewed Japan's compliance
  with the agreement earlier this week.
      The periodic reviews are to continue and the remaining
  sanctions to stay in force, the officials said, until Japan is
  in full compliance with the semiconductor agreement.

  The Soviet Union has agreed to supply

      IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Oil Minister Gholamreza

  agreement was part of a protocol on economic cooperation signed
  during his visit. The amount of crude delivered to the Soviet

      Aqazadeh said the two sides agreed to conduct feasibility

  southern Iran to the Black Sea through the Soviet Union.
      Iran is pursuing the pipeline project to protect part of
  its oil exports from Iraqi air attacks in the Gulf.
      Irna made no mention of natural gas exports to the Soviet

      Iran lost most of its refining capacity early in the Gulf

      Aqazadeh said Soviet refined products would be delivered at

test/15539,"BUNDESBANK SEES NO CHANGE IN MONETARY COURSE
  The Bundesbank sees no current reason
  to change monetary course, vice-president Helmut Schlesinger
  told Reuters in a telephone interview.
      Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks
  yesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and West
  Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which, dealers
  said, revived some speculation that German interest rate cuts
  may once again be under discussion.
      Schlesinger said he had no comment on the remarks of his
  two central bank council colleagues.
      But he added that the last central bank council meeting on
  April 2 had discussed the economic situation with a mood of
  ""subdued optimism,"" particularly influenced by the news brought
  by several state central bank presidents.
      ""Much is going better than the impression gained by the
  public from the January figures, which have been in the
  meantime superseded,"" he said.
      German January industrial output fell 3.0 pct after a
  decline of 0.9 pct in December. New industry orders fell 1.9
  pct after they had been unchanged in December.
      Bank economists said that the two together showed the
  economy would either stagnate or contract in the first quarter
  of 1987.
      Aside from the economic developments, Schlesinger added, a
  steady monetary course was important to hold the dollar/mark
  rate around current levels as Bundesbank president Karl Otto
  Poehl had said while attending the Washington World Bank/IMF
  meeting.
      Asked, however, if the Bundesbank could move to cut rates
  on repurchase agreements at the setting of the next repurchase
  tender, due next Tuesday, Schlesinger said, ""Since the central
  bank council gives its opinion on this theme only every 14
  days, this is hardly probable.""
      Responding to the question whether the Bundesbank had moved
  away from a policy of targetting monetary growth toward one of
  targetting currency rates, Schlesinger said he could have no
  comment on the subject while negotiations were still in
  progress in Washington.

  The two sides in the Rotterdam port
  general cargo dispute have agreed to appoint an independent

  employers' spokesman Gerard Zeebregts said.
      Lammers, Queen's Commissioner for the province of
  Flevoland, will not act as a mediator but will draw up an
  agenda and procedures for meetings between the employers and
  unions on a work-practice agreement and proposed redundancies.
      Two months of strikes in the sector began on January 19 in
  protest at employers' proposals for 350 redundancies from the
  4,000-strong workforce this year.
      The strikes were called off by the main port union FNV on
  March 13 following an Amsterdam court's interim injunction
  against the redundancies on procedural grounds.
      The court is due to make a final ruling on May 7 but
  Zeebregts said he expected the judgment to go against the
  employers and they were therefore very likely to restart the
  complicated legal redundancy procedures in the near future.
      Meanwhile, the dispute over a new work-practice agreement
  in the port's grain sector continued, with 30 maintenance
  workers on strike, although loading was not affected, a

  sector, said.
      The employers have written to the union asking it to
  reconsider its position and a meeting of union members has been
  called for tomorrow.

  South Korea will cut import taxes on 50
  items, including construction equipment, photographic film,

      The tariff cuts, of between five and 30 percentage points,
  take effect on July 1.
      This brings to 157 the number of goods on which import
  taxes have been cut this year, a ministry official said.
      The 157 are among about 290 items on which Washington has
  asked Seoul to lower tariffs, he added.
      Today's announcement follows Saturday's removal of import
  curbs on 170 products. For 46 of those products, the U.S. Had
  had sought free access to the South Korean market.
      ""This is in line with the government's policy to limit our
  trade surplus with the United States to help reduce trade
  friction between the two countries,"" the official said.

  the surplus was expected to widen further in 1987 but Seoul
  would try to hold it below eight billion dlrs.
      The finance ministry said tariffs would be cut later this
  month on a further 53 items, including acrylic yarn and
  ethylene, by an average 7.7 percentage points in order to check

test/16053,"ANALYSTS DOUBT FED FIRMED DESPITE BORROWING RISE
  Economists said that they doubt the
  Federal Reserve is firming policy to aid the dollar, despite
  higher discount window borrowings in the latest two-week
  statement period and very heavy borrowings Wednesday.
      Data out today show net borrowings from the Fed averaged
  393 mln dlrs in the two weeks to Wednesday, up from 265 mln
  dlrs in the prior statement period. Wednesday borrowings were
  1.4 billion dlrs as Federal funds averaged a high 6.45 pct.
      ""One could make a case that the Fed is firming, but it
  probably isn't,"" said William Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds.
      Sullivan said some may assume the Fed has firmed policy
  modestly to support the dollar because net borrowings in the
  two-weeks to Wednesday were nearly 400 mln dlrs after averaging
  around 250 mln dlrs over the previous two months.
      However, the Dean Witter economist noted that the latest
  two-week period included a quarter end when seasonal demand
  often pushes up borrrowings.
      ""Some might argue that the Fed was firming policy, but it
  looks like it tried to play catchup with reserve provisions
  late in the statement period and didn't quite make it,"" said
  Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
      A Fed spokesman told a press press conference today that
  the Fed had no large net one-day miss of two billion dlrs or
  more in its reserve projections in the week ended Wednesday.
      Still, McCarthy said it may have had a cumulative miss in
  its estimates over the week that caused it to add fewer
  reserves earlier in the week than were actually needed.
      The Fed took no market reserve management action last
  Thursday and Friday, the first two days of the week. It added
  temporary reserves indirectly on Monday via two billion dlrs of
  customer repurchase agreements and then supplied reserves
  directly via System repurchases on Tuesday and Wednesday.
      Based on Fed data out today, economists calculated that the
  two-day System repurchase agreements the Fed arrranged on
  Tuesday totaled around 5.9 billion dlrs. They put Wednesday's
  overnight System repos at approximately 3.4 billion dlrs.
      ""It is quite clear that the Fed is not firming policy at
  this time,"" said Larry Leuzzi of S.G. Warburg and Co Inc.
      Citing the view shared by the other two economists, Leuzzi
  said the Fed cannot really afford to seriously lift interest
  rates to help the dollar because that would harm already weak
  economies in the United States and abroad and add to the
  financial stress of developing countries and their lenders.
      ""Those who believe the Fed tightened policy in the latest
  statement period have to explain why it acted before the dollar
  tumbled,"" said McCarthy of Merrill Lynch.
      He said the dollar staged a precipitous drop as a new
  statement period began today on disappointment yesterday's
  Washington meetings of international monetary officials failed
  to produce anything that would offer substantive dollar aid.
      In fact, currency dealers said there was nothing in
  Wednesday's G-7 communique to alter the prevailing view that
  the yen needs to rise further to redress the huge trade
  imbalance between the United States and Japan.
      The economists generally agreed that the Fed is aiming for
  steady policy now that should correspond to a weekly average
  Fed funds rate between six and 6-1/8 pct. This is about where
  the rate has been since early November.
      ""I'm not so sure that the Fed is engineering a tighter
  policy to help the dollar, as some suspect,"" said Sullivan of
  Dean Witter.
      If it is, however, he said that Fed probably has just
  nudged up its funds rate goal to around 6.25 to 6.35 pct from
  six to 6.10 pct previously.

test/15043,"FURTHER ARGENTINE COARSE GRAIN LOSSES FEARED
  Argentine grain producers adjusted
  their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop
  downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the
  end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said.
      They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates
  had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which
  has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.
      However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend,
  producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain
  could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.
      Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27
  millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in
  Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in
  Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.
      There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.
      Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce
  rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the
  crops, including soybean.
      However, as the lands began drying later in the week
  harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40
  pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.
      Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested
  material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield
  estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.
      The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at
  2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast
  last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of
  4.1 mln.
      Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9
  to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.
      Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area
  sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will
  begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.
      Production estimates for maize were down from last week at
  9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated
  previously.
      This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln
  tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and
  21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln
  tonnes.
      Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to
  seven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.
      Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in
  Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and
  Buenos Aires in mid-April.
      The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3
  to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.
      The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln
  tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week,
  and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2
  mln tonne crop.
      The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted,
  remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5
  pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for
  1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of
  7.1 mln.
      The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln
  to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln
  sown in 1985/86.
      The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some
  areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some
  experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas
  making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on
  this were not available.
      Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which
  will be sown between May and August or September, has so far
  not been as intense as in previous years.

      But if Washington seizes the initiative with bolder steps
  -- such as mining Iran's harbors, blockading its shipping, or
  destroying key bases -- it could find itself in a major war.
      ""Iran is in the driver's seat in an absolute sense as the
  cycle of attack and retaliation continues,"" said Fred Axelgard,
  a Gulf War expert with the private Center for Strategic and
  International Studies (CSIS).
      ""It's like a Greek tragedy,"" said retired Adm. Eugene Carroll
  of Washington's private Center for Defense Information (CDI)
  think tank.
      Some Middle East experts say the only way out is for
  Washington to join forces with Moscow in pressing for an end to
  the war between Iran and Iraq.
      They say it is not feasible for America to withdraw its
  30-ship force from the Gulf area, where the Navy began
  escorting U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tankers in July. Withdrawal 
  would give the appearance of being chased away by Iran, which
  President Reagan could never accept.
      U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger told a Pentagon
  news conference the destroyers Kidd, Young, Leftwich and Hoel
  fired about 1,000 rounds of five-inch shells at Iran's Rostam
  oil rig 120 miles east of Bahrain beginning at about 1400 Gulf
  time (0700 EDT) on Monday.
      Weinberger said the platform had been used as a military
  base by Iran and that the attack responded to an Iranian
  Silkworm missile strike on the U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti tanker Sea
  Isle City on Friday.
      Iranians manning the platform were warned in advance and
  allowed to escape.
      ""We do not seek further confrontation with Iran, but we will
  be prepared to meet any escalation of military action by Iran
  with stronger countermeasures,"" Weinberger said.
      ""We consider this matter closed,"" he said.
      Analysts ranging from the liberal CDI to conservatives
  agreed the U.S. reaction was measured, reasonable and did not
  escalate the conflict unduly. But they said the question was
  whether Iran would consider the matter closed. It had not taken
  this view after earlier clashes.

  Australian Minister for Trade
  Negotiations Michael Duffy said his country and Third World
  commodity producers have formed an effective lobby group
  against farm export subsidies and market access restrictions.
      Duffy told a press conference the Cairns Group of 14 major
  agricultural producers, to which Australia and Thailand belong,
  has emerged as an important third force in any multilateral
  trade talks. ""There's no doubt that the Cairns Group is being
  seen as a third force to be reckoned with both inside the
  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and in other
  international trade negotiations,"" he said.
      Duffy, here on a three-day visit after talks in the United
  States, The European Community (EC) and Latin America, said
  considerable progress has been made by the group towards
  fighting costly protectionist policies pursued by developed
  countries.
      The minister said the EC Commission's new farm trade paper
  will recognise the heavy financial burdens imposed by its
  Common Agricultural Policy and its future expansion.
      He said the Reagan Administration has also displayed a
  determination to resist the currently strong protectionist
  sentiment in the U.S. Congress.

  Italy's Foreign Trade Minister Mario
  Sarcinelli, commenting on speculation in the Italian press,
  said a sharp balance of payments deficit in May could not be
  attributed to recent moves liberalizing the purchase of foreign
  securities.
      Sarcinelli was reacting to suggestions that last month's
  overall 3,211 billion lire deficit, which compares with April's
  2,040 billion surplus, could be linked to a May 13 decree
  abolishing obligatory non-interest-bearing deposits on foreign
  securities purchases.
     ""The deficit can be better attributed to premature and
  delayed foreign trade payments and receipts (leads and lags)
  rather than capital outflow to portfolio investment,"" Sarcinelli
  said in a statement.
      Earlier today the newspaper La Repubblica cited remarks by
  the Bank of Italy, which announced the deficit for May and said
  it had been partly caused by ""non-banking capital outflows.""
      ""In practice, it seems that there has been a constant flow
  of capital to foreign securities or investments outside our
  borders,"" said the newspaper.
      But the newspaper added that it was still not possible to
  say how far the move to abolish foreign securities purchase
  deposits had affected Italy's balance of payments.

  Recent announcements from Moscow of
  next year's grain production targets indicate that the Soviets
  are estimating this year's grain crop at 205 to 213 mln tonnes,
  Agriculture Department analysts said.
      USDA is projecting the Soviet crop at 210 mln tonnes, but
  some earlier estimates from Soviet officials were that the 1987
  grain crop could match the 1978 record of 237 mln tonnes.
      Moscow outlined its economic targets for 1988 on Monday,
  putting the grain harvest goal at 235 mln tonnes. An analyst of
  Soviet agriculture at USDA noted that a recent article in
  Izvestia said Soviet grain production in 1988 is planned to be
  ""25 to 30 mln tonnes more than expected this year.""
      ""This indicates that their own estimate is for a 205 to 213
  mln tonne (grain) crop,"" the analyst said.
     
      In calculating Moscow's crop estimate, USDA used the 235
  mln tonne production goal, as well as a 238 mln tonne figure
  published in a Soviet economic journal this month.
      USDA's production estimate of 210 mln tonnes reflects a
  range of 207 to 212 mln tonnes, a USDA source said.
      Late season rains damaged Soviet crops, slowed harvest
  progress and lowered Soviet production, analysts said.
      While in the U.S. earlier this month, Soviet agriculture
  official Viktor Nikonov predicted that the grain crop would be
  as good or better than last year's 210 mln tonne harvest.
      A member of Nikonov's party commented that although 230 mln
  tonnes of grain were in the fields, harvest problems would
  bring the final crop down to around 210 mln tonnes.

  West German Finance Minister Gerhard
  Stoltenberg said today's meetings of major industrial countries
  would look at ways of strengthening the Paris accord on
  stabilizing foreign exchange rates.
      Stoltenberg told journalists he saw no fundamental weakness
  of the February 22 agreement of the Group of Five countries and
  Canada to keep exchange rates near the then-current levels.
      But he declined to say what measures would be discussed
  ahead of a communique of the Group of Seven ministers later
  today.
      Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said
  the importance of the Paris agreement, also known as the Louvre
  accord, had been underestimated.
      Stoltenberg said there is greater agreement now among major
  countries than six months ago, at the time of the annual
  meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank,
  marked by sharp discord between the United States and its major
  trading partners.
      ""There is no fundamental weakness of the Paris accord,"" he
  said. ""We will be looking at ways of strengthening it, but I do
  not want to discuss that here.
      Stoltenberg said the Louvre agreement was working despite a
  ""slight firming"" of the yen against the dollar.
      And Poehl noted that the dollar/mark parity was unchanged
  since February 22 without the Bundesbank having had to sell
  marks to support the dollar.
      ""The Louvre agreement has been honored by the market,"" he
  said.
      Poehl said West Germany had lived up to its side of the
  bargain in Paris by preparing the way for tax cuts to be
  accelerated as a way of stimulating growth.
      Poehl said, however, that Japan had not yet fulfilled its
  pledges for economic stimulation.
      ""And we will have to see if the United States is able to do
  what they promised in Paris on reducing the budget deficit --
  and get it through Congress,"" he added.
      Stoltenberg reiterated West German concern about a further
  fall in the dollar, noting that the mark was up 85 pct against
  the dollar and nearly 20 pct on a trade-weighted basis.
      ""You cannot expect that to go unnoticed in an economy. And
  it is not just a German problem, it is a European problem,"" he
  said.

  Phelps Dodge Corp chairman G. Robert
  Durham said the company is prepared to make another large
  non-copper acquisition and that a deal could be struck in the
  near future.
      In an interview with Reuters, Durham said the company was
  examining potential candidates but not yet talking with any.
      He declined to name the companies but said a deal could
  occur as soon as the second half of 1987.
     
      Phelps Dodge, which ranks as the largest copper producer in
  the U.S., last year paid 240 mln dlrs for Columbian Chemicals
  Co, a maker of carbon black which is used in rubber and tires
  among other products.
      The purchase was part of a strategic plan to diversify and
  eventually match earnings from non-copper operations and copper
  operations.
      Phelps Dodge could spend between 250 mln and 500 mln dlrs
  to buy another non-copper company, Durham said, citing about
  100 mln dlrs of cash and 580 mln dlrs of untapped bank credit.
     
      Any acquisition candidate would have to have a different
  economic cycle than copper, substantial earnings and good
  management, he said. Phelps Dodge would only want a friendly
  deal, he added.
      ""We're not talking high-tech, or financial services or
  about a perfume company,"" he said. ""We want a good basic
  industrial company that will fit into our management
  structure,"" Durham said.
     
      During the interview, Durham and other executives also said
  continued strong demand and tight copper supply should lead to
  higher prices for the metal.
      ""In my view, it's not a matter of if but when the price
  (for copper) will improve because there aren't that many new
  projects coming on, and demand, short of a major recession,
  will continue to grow modestly,"" said executive vice president
  Douglas Yearley. Phelps Dodge continues to lower its cost of
  producing copper, the executives said. Costs should be below 50
  cents a pound, after depreciation but before interest and
  corporate expense, by 1989 or 1990.
      Production costs are about 56 to 57 cents a pound now
  compared to one dlr a pound in 1981, some Wall St analysts
  said.
      Durham said copper supplies are lower than they have been
  for almost 20 years and demand continued to be strong.
      He declined to project results for the second quarter or
  year. But he said the quarter was going well and the rise in
  copper prices in the last month will help results.
      Durham said last month that the second quarter should match
  the first quarter when earnings rose about 11 pct to 16.8 mln
  dlrs or 49 cts a share.
      First quarter sales rose 61.5 pct to 372.9 mln dlrs,
  reflecting the acquisition of Columbian Chemicals and increased
  copper shipments from the Chino copper mine in New Mexico, also
  acquired last year.
      Analysts are projecting 1987 earnings of 2.20 dlrs to 2.75
  dlrs a share, up sharply from 1.79 dlrs in 1986.

  Canada will propose at the new round of

      ""Agricultural subsidies and trade barriers have created a
  vicious circle which continues to cause problems of

      Carney was outlining the government's new position on the

  multilateral talks under the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs
  and Trade).
      While few details were released, Carney said the government

  barriers.
      ""Under the Canadian proposal, all countries would have to
  ensure that domestic policies and programs to address the
  specific needs of their farm sectors do not distort trade,"" a

  credit could be given to countries which effectively control

test/20259,"LOUVRE REAFFIRMATION NOT ENOUGH - U.K. ANALYSTS
  U.S. And West German reaffirmation of
  support for the Louvre Accord cannot cure the fundamental
  problems bedevilling the world economy which lie behind the
  current collapse in stock markets, London economists said.
      ""There's going to have to be some acknowledgement that the
  dollar is going to be allowed to slip,"" said Richard Jeffrey of
  Hoare Govett. ""If not, there is going to be continued fear that
  when pressure emerges on the dollar, the Fed will be forced to
  tighten. This throws up the economic abyss of recession in the
  U.S. With obvious knock on effects on the rest of the world.""
      But some economists added that Wall Street's crash, which
  dragged other major markets down with it, may help curb the
  very problems that sparked the turmoil - namely world inflation
  fears and the massive and persistent U.S. Trade deficits.
      ""If there is a benefit from a 23 pct fall in Wall Street
  ...It's some sort of resistance to inflation worldwide,"" said
  Geoffrey Dennis of brokers James Capel, echoing comments from
  other London and Tokyo analysts.
      Lower personal wealth from lower stock prices and fears of
  further falls should dampen credit growth, curbing inflationary
  pressures and import demand in the U.S., They say.
      Such considerations may be helping bond markets resist the
  equity crash, according to Mike Osborne of Kleinwort Grieveson.
      ""It would be suicidal for any government in the context of
  what happened in the last couple of days to jack up their
  interest rates,"" he added.
      Stocks surged after news Chemical Bank cut its prime
  lending rate half a point to 9.25 pct Tuesday and U.S. Fed
  chairman Alan Greenspan pledged support for the financial
  system.
      The news eroded the most immediate fears that the stock
  collapse would spill over into the economy, via a banking
  crisis for example, thus precipitating recession.
      It also helped the dollar rally sharply, to a high of
  1.8200 marks from a European low of 1.7880. But economists said
  today's whiplash moves do not have long term significance and
  that markets should try to keep the underlying fundamentals in
  mind.
      ""The United States has been able to live on borrowed time.
  If the effect of this (crash) is to produce slower economic
  growth not recession...It contains good news (and) provides a
  more realistic assessment of the U.S. Economy,"" said Capel's
  Dennis. But he added that markets are still very much in
  danger.
      ""The liquidity doesn't disappear...All it's doing is
  disappearing from the equity markets,"" Dennis noted.
      David Morrison of Goldman Sachs International said world
  market turbulence will be exacerbated if the Group of Seven
  (G-7) leading western nations confirms a base for the dollar,
  as implied by West German Finance Minister Gerhard
  Stoltenberg's remarks that intervention to support currencies
  is still on.
      Last week's dollar fall was partly triggered by
  expectations that the Germans were more worried about the money
  supply impact of such intervention than maintaining currency
  stability.
      But rigid adherence to dollar ranges would be bad, said
  Morrison. ""The Louvre Accord is fundamentally misconceived. To
  stabilise the dollar at too high a level is wrong,"" he said.

  Irving Bank Corp said a six pct drop
  in first-quarter net income from a year earlier was largely the
  result of placing medium- and long-term loans to borrowers in
  Brazil and Ecuador on non-accrual status.
      Income in the first three months fell to 28.60 mln dlrs
  from 30.43 mln in the same 1986 period. Earnings per share
  dropped to 1.51 dlrs from 1.62.
      Irving put 215 mln dlrs of Brazilian and 33 mln dlrs of
  Ecuadorean loans on non-accrual, reducing first-quarter net
  income by a total of 4.4 mln dlrs after tax.
      Irving estimates full year net would be reduced by 15.3 mln
  dlrs after tax if no cash interest payments are received on
  these loans during the remainder of 1987.
      Also adversely affecting earnings were losses on the
  trading of securities and higher non-interest expenses,
  although these were partly offset by increased trust income,
  profits from foreign exchange trading and investment securities
  gains, the bank said.
      The allowance for loan losses was 224.8 mln dlrs, up from
  185.2 mln a year earlier. The provision for loan losses was
  21.8 mln versus 19.5 mln in the first quarter of 1986.

test/18973,"SENATOR DEFENDS U.S. MANDATORY FARM CONTROL BILL
  Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, defended his
  controversial mandatory supply control farm bill and said U.S.
  farmers should be allowed to vote in a referendum whether they
  approve of the proposal.
      The Harkin proposal would set loan rates of 5.17 dlrs per
  bushel for wheat, 3.77 dlrs for corn and 9.32 dlrs for
  soybeans, all to be put in effect under strict controls on
  planted acreage reductions. Present loan rates are 2.28 dlrs
  for wheat, 1.92 for corn, and effectively 4.56 for soybeans.
      Also under the plan, the U.S. would seek a world market
  sharing cartel with the European Community and other exporting
  nations, to share-out export markets, Harkin said during the
  first of several Senate Agriculture subcommittee hearings
  examining farm programs.
      Harkin made the following claims in testimony on his
  ""Family Farm Act.""
      -- The mandatory control bill would increase farm income
  and reduce government spending on agriculture.
      -- Harkin said his policy of high price supports would not
  ruin U.S. agricultural exports as critics claim, but would
  increase overall revenue from exports.
      This would be done by seeking agreement among major
  exporting countries including the European Community on market
  sharing at agreed high prices.
      Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., countered during the hearing
  that such a grain export cartel is not workable.
      -- Harkin acknowledged that higher commodity price supports
  would be passed onto consumers, but he said high food prices
  stem more from ""gouging"" by food processing companies than from
  high farm product prices.
      Harkin cited what he termed ""excessive"" net returns on
  equity over five years of 33.4 pct at Kellogg, 31.9 pct
  Monfort, 22.8 pct Nabisco, 22.8 pct ConAgra, 21.2 pct H.J.
  Heinz, 19.1 pct Ralston Purina, 17.2 pct Pillsbury and 16.7 pct
  Quaker Oats.
      -- Harkin said a ""legitimate"" concern about his bill would
  be the impact of higher prices on livestock producers.
      He said as a transition to the higher prices, he would
  allow livestock producers to purchase Commodity Credit Corp.
  grain stocks for three years.
      Thereafter, livestock farmers would benefit from a
  ""predictable and stable"" grain price, he said.
      -- Harkin said that under his policy approach farm
  participation would be no more ""mandatory"" than the current
  farm program. He said farmers now must participate in farm
  programs in order to receive credit for planting and to protect
  farm income.

  Bank of Japan sources said the bank
  has no plans to cut its discount rate.
      They told reporters that there was no pressure on Japan
  during the Group of Seven (G-7) meeting here yesterday to lower
  its discount rate. They added that they themselves do not feel
  any need for a cut at all.
      Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told reporters
  earlier today that some countries - those with strong
  currencies - might have to cut interest rates.
      The Bank of Japan sources also said that it was too soon to
  call the G-7 pact a failure.
      The central bank sources were commenting on the dollar's
  renewed tumble in New York and Tokyo, which was sparked by
  remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the
  dollar's fall had been orderly.
      They said the market must have misinterpreted Baker's
  comments because he was referring to the dollar's fall since
  the Plaza agreement in September 1985, over a long-time span,
  not the currency's recent movements.
      They added that the foreign exchange markest seem to seize
  on anything to use as an excuse to drive the dollar one way or
  the other.
      The Bank of Japan sources said the U.S. Is putting more
  weight on the dollar/yen rate in terms of judging market
  stability than on other currencies.
      Throughout the G-7 meeting, Japan pointed to the dangers
  that would arise from a further dollar fall because it would
  reduce the flow of Japanese capital to the U.S., Hurting the
  U.S. And world economies, they said.
      In February and in March of this year, Japanese investors
  reduced their purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds, the sources
  said.
      Each country in the G-7 - Britain, Canada, France, Italy,
  Japan, the U.S. And West Germany - has a different view about
  currency stability, the Bank of Japan sources said.
      This is because the overall foreign exchange market is a
  triangle of dollar/yen, European currencies/yen and
  dollar/European currencies.
      At the time of the Louvre agreement, European countries did
  not want the yen to weaken against their currencies so they did
  not object to the yen strengthening, they said.

test/14982,"PROXMIRE OUTLINES INSIDER TRADING LEGISLATION
  Senate Banking Committee Chairman
  William Proxmire (D-Wis) said he planned to introduce
  legislation shortly to require greater public disclosure of
  corporate takeovers and fairer treatment for all shareholders.
      Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers,
  Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increased
  the chance that Congress will act to curb abuses.
      ""We are proposing legislation that would provide for more
  disclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and would
  insure that takeovers are properly financed,"" he said.
      Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the threshold
  for notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that a
  investor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in a
  company to three pct from the current five pct threshold within
  10 days, Proxmire said.
      In addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirement
  that an investor intended to aquire three pct that would have
  to filed with the SEC.
      Proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant to
  prevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public in
  knowing about coming takeover attempts.
      Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that a
  tender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60
  business days from the current 20 business days.
      His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiring
  company violated the time period on the tender offer.
      To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmire
  said the legislation would aim at insuring current margin
  requirments are properly enforced.
      The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirement
  for purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generally
  enforced in hostile takeovers.
      Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeover
  declare that they can raise the capital for a takeover without
  actually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said.
      He said his bill would allow private suits for damages for
  failure to meet the Federal Reserve's 50 pct margin
  requirements.
      The bill also would require more disclose when several
  investors form an alliance in a hostile takeover.
      ""When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to know
  about it,"" Proxmire said.
      Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britain
  towards two-tiered tender offers that insures that all
  shareholders recieve equal treatment.
      He said he expected amendments to the bill also would cover
  defensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills.
      Proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later this
  month and predicted the Senate committee would act this spring.
      He said he was hopeful Congress could pass a bill this
  year.

  Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said

  intervened heavily to support the dollar against the yen.
      Yesterday's intervention was large in terms of the
  countries involved and the amounts expended, he said.
      With the continued fall of the dollar against the yen,
  0speculation had arisen in currency markets here that Japan
  might take new measures to support the U.S. Currency, such as
  curbing capital outflows.
      Miyazawa said that yesterday's news of a 4.3 pct rise in
  U.S. Gnp in the first quarter had been expected. Although the
  growth looks robust on the surface, the figures in reality are
  not that good, he said.
      He said the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is
  expected to come up with a final set of recommendations of ways
  to stimulate the Japanese economy before Prime Minister
  Yasuhiro Nakasone leaves for Washington next week.
      Commenting on yesterday's report on economic restructuring

  U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker
  met West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and

  agreed to support the Louvre pact, the Treasury Department
  said.
      The Treasury described the meeting as ""a very positive,

  agreed upon last week. ""The parties agreed to continue economic
  cooperation under the Louvre agreement and its flexible
  application including cooperation on exchange rate stability

      The Treasury said Baker and Stoltenberg ""are consulting with
  their G-7 colleagues and are confident that this will enable
  them to foster exchange rate stability around current levels.""
      The Louvre pact is an agreement between the Group of Seven
  leading industrial countries including the United States and
  West Germany to promote currency stability.
      Baker was scheduled to visit Scandinavia and Belgium this
  week and the department earlier refused to release details of

  Federal Reserve Board Vice-Chairman
  Manuel Johnson cautioned against seeking ""quick-fix solutions"" to
  persistent U.S. trade and federal budget deficits.
      In particular, he told an American Stock Exchange
  conference, a decline in the dollar below current levels would
  exacerbate financial market conditions.
      ""Trying to artificially depress the dollar severely below
  current levels ... would exacerbate financial market conditions
  and lead to further potential for financial problems.""
      Nowhere, Johnson said, are Fed officials hearing that U.S.
  businesses cannot compete at current exchange rates.
      He acknowledged the U.S. trade deficit was persisting
  despite a decline in the dollar's value of 40 to 50 pct in the
  past two years.
      But the deficit is improving in volume terms and will soon
  begin showing improvement.
      ""The stage I think is being set for a healthy, constructive
  expansion without inflationary instability,"" he said.

  U.S. oil traders said Texaco Inc's
  filing for protection under the Chapter 11 bankruptcy code is
  adding uncertainty to an already skittish oil market, but
  opinions are divided on the impact to the market.
      ""The filing is holding up wet barrel trading today,"" said
  one trader. ""Everyone is talking about it, assessing their
  company's situations in relation to Texaco,"" he added.
       Some traders said companies that deal with Texaco are
  concerned about whether they will receive payment or supplies
  under the bankruptcy filing.
      However, others were less worried. ""The first paid will be
  the trading community and those connected with Texaco in the
  shipping industry,"" one New York trader said.
      ""If Texaco doesn't get crude supplies it can't run its
  refineries, so its other assets would not be worth anything,""
  he added.
      Texaco filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
  bankruptcy code yesterday after failing to reach a settlement
  with Pennzoil on an 11 billion dlrs court award for illegally
  interferring with Pennzoil's proposed purchase of Getty Oil Co.
      However, others were less worried. ""The first paid will be

  interferring with Pennzoil's proposed purchase of Getty Oil Co.
      ""There is some reluctance to trade with Texaco but no great
  change,"" said another trader, adding that traders are tending
  toward prudence in their dealings with the company.
      Traders are assessing whether to require cash prepayment or
  letters of credit, or to continue to trade as usual with Texaco
  on an open line basis, he said.
      Another trader, however, described today's activity as
  business as usual, adding that traders feel more secure because
  no liens can be put on Texaco's assets while it is in
  bankruptcy.
      Traders said there was no apparent effect of the Texaco
  filing on crude futures trading although they said the exchange
  might lower Texaco's position limit and require higher margins
  for Texaco's trades.
      New York Mercantile Exchange President Rosemary McFadden
  declined to comment on Texaco's futures trading, saying that is
  is proprietary information. McFadden did say, however, that as
  a matter of procedure, it is possible the exchange can lower
  allowable position limits or increase margin requirements for
  companies that are in financial trouble.

test/16727,"MERRILL TO GET 30 MLN DLR FEE IN BORG &lt;BOR> DEAL
  Merrill Lynch and Co Inc &lt;MER>
  subsidiary seeking to take over of Borg-Warner Corp said it
  could realize a 30 mln dlr fee for its efforts, whether or not
  the deal, which it values at 4.7 billion dlrs, succeeds.
      In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
  Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc said it would receive a 30
  mln dlr fee from the surviving company for acting as dealer
  manager of the merger after the Borg-Warner deal is completed.
      But it said it could also receive a break-up fee of 30 mln
  dlrs if the deal fails for reasons, which include another party
  holding more than 40 pct of its stock or tendering for 50 pct.
      The 30 mln dlr fee is among the highest set down in any
  tender offer agreement, either in compensation for dealer
  manager services or for break-up of the deal.
      Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, backed by a group of
  investors it organized, has launched a 48.50 dlr a share tender
  offer for Borg-Warner for 90 pct of its stock.
      The company's board has approved the plan, which was
  intended to thwart an unsolicited offer from GAF Corp.
      Borg-Warner also agreed to redeem all outstanding Series A
  preferred shares and to pay off on all options at a 48.50 dlr a
  share exercise price before the merger is effective, it said.
      Merrill Lynch said its representatives discussed a possible
  leveraged buyout with Borg-Warner as early as last December.
      At that time, Merrill Lynch told the company it would
  consider a 43 dlr a share tender offer in cash and securities,
  if the Borg-Warner board approved, it said. On Feb 24, it said
  it was told the company had decided against a buyout.
      But talks were revived after GAF launched its 46 dlr a
  share proposal on March 31, Merrill Lynch said.
      Unlike its earlier proposal, Merrill Lynch said Borg-Warner
  management was asked not to take part in the new deal and it
  was conditioned upon payment of the fees.
      In addition to its fees, Merrill Lynch said it will also
  get up to 17 mln dlrs from Borg-Warner to cover its expenses in
  the tender offer.
      Merrill Lynch said it would continue operating Borg-Warner
  as a subsidiary with its current officers keeping their
  positions.
      But for flexibility purposes, Merrill Lynch said it is
  considering redistributing Borg-Warner's assets to a number of
  subsdiaries of an entity it created to carry out the merger.
      All in all Merrill Lynch estimated that there would be 130
  mln dlrs in fees and expenses connected with the deal.
      Another 250 mln dlrs will be needed to repay certain debt
  of Borg-Warner, Merrill Lynch said.
      To finance the deal, Merrill Lynch said it expects to
  borrow 3.5 billion dlrs from a group of banks and sell 100 mln
  dlrs of common stock of the new company, sell 100 mln dlrs of
  non-voting preferred stock of the new company to Merrill Lynch
  and Co, sell up to 650 mln dlrs of subordinated notes to
  Merrill Lynch and Co and sell to the public 204 mln dlrs of
  subordinated discount debentures.
      GAF has raised its offer to 48 dlrs a share cash.

test/15444,"GERMAN MONEY MARKET SPLIT ON LOWER RATE PROSPECTS
  Remarks by central bankers raised some
  hopes the Bundesbank will cut rates on securities repurchase
  pacts, but operators remained divided on the likelihood of a
  move in the near term, money market dealers said.
      Comments by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler yesterday
  that rate cuts were needed to curb money supply growth from
  speculative capital inflows, and by West Berlin state central
  bank president Dieter Hiss that there was no natural lower
  limit to the discount rate had, however, no immediate impact.
      Call money declined to 3.65/75 pct from 3.75/85 pct but the
  drop was tied to extra liquidity in the market, dealers said.
      Dealers said the Bundesbank's latest liquidity allotment
  this week dashed some hopes of lower rates.
      The Bundesbank allotted only 6.1 billion marks yesterday in
  new liquidity in a repurchase pact at an unchanged rate of 3.80
  pct, thus subtracting some 8.8 billion marks from the market,
  as an outgoing 14.9 billion pact expired.
      But some dealers said the smaller volume awarded by the
  pact was in line with present liquid money market conditions,
  and did not exlude a cut in the repurchase pact rate soon to
  3.70 pct if money market rates continue at present levels.
      The next opportunity for the Bundesbank to lower rates on
  repurchase pacts will be in a tender expected next Tuesday.
      Bundesbank officials have already said they favour more
  discreet rate adjustments through repurchase pacts, rather than
  the more public adjustment of leading rates.
      The Bundesbank may either set a fixed allocation rate and
  allow banks to tender for the volume, as has been the case
  since it lowered its discount rate January 22, or else it may
  allow banks to tender for the rate and set the volume itself.

  Japan is disappointed at the recent threats

  Indonesia rejected World Bank
  recommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, as
  the country's foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5
  billion dlrs in grants and soft loans.
      Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarks
  distributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations met
  at The Hague, said, ""The general argument presented by the Bank
  for this free trade, open economy view is weak.""
      The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages the
  largest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agricultural
  growth was stagnating under subsisides for rice farming.
      The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peaked
  and the subsidies are a waste of money.
      Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and provides
  an income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies were
  needed to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,
  exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well as
  assisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.
      Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmers
  should be free to choose their own crops, but he said the
  government would continue to maintain production targets for
  ""strategic commodities"" such as rice and sugar.
      The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia's
  drive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are double
  the world average because of inefficiencies, and the country
  would save money by importing the commodity.
      However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the need
  to save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugar
  industry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.
      He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in the
  agricultural sector were needed to help domestic industry
  develop and because of ""over-production and price intervention
  in the developed nations.""

test/14921,"SAN MIGUEL DEAL HIT BY MORE LAWSUITS
  A bid by San Miguel Corp (SMC) &lt;SANM.MN>
  to buy back 38.1 mln sequestered shares from United Coconut
  Planters Bank (UCPB) has been hit by two new lawsuits, sources
  in the Philippine food and brewery company said.
      A Manila court yesterday issued an injunction barring UCPB
  from selling the shares, which represent 31 pct of SMC's
  outstanding capital stock of 121 mln shares, until hearings on
  April 21 on a petition filed by Eduardo Cojuangco, a former
  chairman of both SMC and UCPB.
      Cojuangco said the Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF)
  and 1.4 mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares.
      Cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by UCPB and
  represented a blue chip investment. His petition said UCPB's
  plans to sell the shares to SMC were ""a serious breach of
  fiduciary duties.""
      The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also be
  held up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securities
  and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Eduardo de los Angeles, a
  government nominee on the company's board.
      De los Angeles, who represents SMC's minority stockholders,
  asked the SEC to block the transaction, approved last week by
  the company's board.
      On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of the
  sequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos per
  share. De los Angeles told the SEC the company's retained
  earnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by the
  purchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration of
  dividends.
      De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violate
  an SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debt
  to equity ratio. He quoted SMC's chief financial director Ramon
  del Rosario as telling the board that the transaction would
  boost the ratio to 2.5-to-1.
      In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earlier
  suit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman Andres
  Soriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties.
      De los Angeles' earlier complaint related to SMC assuming
  last December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC's Hong Kong
  subsidiary &lt;Neptunia Corp> for a down payment on the shares.
  The loan assumption was again ratified by last week's board
  meeting.
      An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino to
  resolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report by
  April 15.
      ""The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part of
  a continuing attempt by certain elements, in complete disregard
  of the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an early
  disposition of the sequestered shares,"" San Miguel Corp said in
  a statement.
      ""Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB have
  reached agreement on the price of the shares and the method of
  payment, this suit is in direct contravention of the
  government's expressed desire to reach an amicable settlement
  of the controversy by April 15,"" the statement added.
      A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment on
  Cojuangco's court petition, adding: ""Any statement coming from
  us might be interpreted as adversarial.""
      Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel which
  sequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligible
  to buy the major portion of the shares because he was a United
  States citizen.
      The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln ""A"" shares,
  which can only be owned by Filipinos, and 14 mln ""B"" shares which
  are available to foreign buyers.
      SMC sources said Soriano personally was not among
  prospective buyers. They said the shares would be purchased by
  the &lt;A.Soriano> group of companies, SMC, Neptunia and unnamed
  institutional investors. Soriano was named as one of the buyers
  in a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB.
      The sale was aborted when Diaz's Presidential Commission on
  Good Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they were
  owned by Cojuangco, a close associate of former President
  Ferdinand Marcos. Cojuangco lives in self-imposed exile in the
  U.S.. The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend
  announced last June.
      ""We have no objection to Soriano buying the ""B"" shares,"" Diaz
  told Reuters. ""But everything is on hold now.""
      The SMC spokesman said he did not know if the controversy
  would be resolved before the company's annual stockholders'
  meeting, scheduled for May 14.
      San Miguel Corp reported sales revenue of 12.2 billion
  pesos in 1986, 11 pct above its 10.9 billion peso sales in
  1985. It said unaudited net profit was in the neighbourhood of
  700 mln pesos, an increase of about 50 pct over 1985.

test/16777,"JAPAN FARM REFORM A KEY TO TRIMMING TRADE SURPLUS
  Basic reform of Japan's protected farm
  sector is a key to shifting its economy away from export to
  domestic-led growth, a vital step if it is to trim its trade
  surplus, securities analysts said.
      The farm sector, which is protected by import tariffs and
  quotas, propped up by subsidies and price supports, and
  sheltered by the tax system, has ample room for change, they
  said.
      ""In economic terms, reform would be a plus,"" said Christopher
  Chew of brokerage firm James Capel and Co.
      The ultimate cost of the existing system is food prices
  twice those in Europe and two to three times those in the U.S.,
  The analysts said.
      Spending on food accounts for about one quarter of the
  average household's budget and roughly 10 pct of the gross
  national product (GNP), according to a study by Chew.
      Reducing these prices could increase household spending
  power by five pct, his study said. The money could be spent on
  products which would have a more direct impact in boosting
  domestic growth, it added.
      ""There's a lot of slack,"" a U.S. Government official in Tokyo
  said. ""All that money could be spent on something else.""
      Direct central government subsidies to the farm sector
  amount to some five billion dlrs per year. Independent
  estimates put total subsidies from all sources as high as 37
  billion and the analysts said much of that money is wasted.
      Changing tax laws to encourage city residents who only farm
  on weekends to put their land up for sale for residential
  development would also give a boost to domestic spending,
  economists said.
      ""Housing construction is the key strategic variable in the
  expansion of domestic demand,"" wrote Chihiro Nakajima, professor
  at Kyoto Gakuen University.
      Japanese business groups are calling for staged farm reform
  to shift some of the burden of trade friction and economic
  restructuring away from the manufacturing sector and onto the
  farm sector. Employers groups also want change. ""If you really
  want to expand domestic demand, the way to do it is not to
  raise wages recklessly, but to reduce commodity prices,"" Bumpei
  Otsuki, President of the Japan Federation of Employers'
  Associations told a recent press conference.
      External pressures are rising as the U.S. And Europe seek
  removal of tariffs and quotas to help reduce their trade
  deficits with Japan.
      But vested Japanese interests opposed to change remain well
  entrenched, dimming prospects for quick reform, analysts said.
      Although the full-time farm population is falling and there
  are signs the LDP is paying more attention to urban
  constituencies, the ruling party remains heavily dependent on
  farm votes in the rural areas. One rural vote is worth several
  city votes due to the pattern of constituency borders.
      The LDP is already in political trouble over its tax reform
  plan and does not want to raise another sticky issue so soon,
  the analysts said.
      Consumer groups are politically weak and tend to accept the
  traditional view that higher prices are a small fee to pay for
  national food security, they said.
      Powerful agricultural cooperatives are fiercely opposed to
  import liberalisation, but are more flexible about reforms
  aimed at stepping up productivity, they said.
      Reform, when it comes, will be in response to specific
  pressure rather than an all-embracing program, said Chew.

      The department said the provision of the Farm Disaster

  U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker met West

      After the meeting the spokesman quoted Stoltenberg as
  saying he was confident that foreign currencies could be
  stabilised at around current levels.
      The meeting came after Baker criticised West Germany for
  increasing short-term money market interest rates. He had said
  the rise was not in line with the spirit of the Louvre accord
  aimed at stabilizing the U.S. dollar last February.
      The meeting had been arranged last week, the spokesman
  said. Baker, Stoltenberg and Poehl had agreed to pursue the
  policies agreed under the Louvre pact with reference to
  currency stability and monetary policy.
      Earlier on Monday the Bundesbnak injected liquidity into
  the West German money market in a move which money market
  dealers interpreted as an attempt by the West German monetary
  authority to curb interest rate rises.
      The spokesman described Monday's talks, which he called

  Spectra-Physics Inc said it is
  considering the possibility of recapitalizing, restructuring,
  or seeking a buyer for the company following its rejection of
  an unsolicitied 32 dlr a share bid from Ciba-Geigy Corp.
      In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
  the San Jose, Calif., gas lasers and accessories company also
  said its board Sunday agreed to a plan that gives 52 top
  executives bonuses ranging from 20 to 50 pct of their base
  salary if they stay with the company through August 29.
      In rejecting the takeover proposal by the U.S. subsidiary
  of Swiss-based Ciba-Geigy AG, the company said it was unfair.
      The Spectra-Physics board voted unanimously, with two
  Ciba-Geigy representatives not participating, to reject the
  Swiss-based chemical and pharmaceutical company's takeover bid,
  citing an opinion from its financial advsior, Morgan Stanley
  and Co Inc, that it is ""inadequate and unfair from a financial
  point of view to the holders of shares,"" the company said.
      The board also authorized a special committee and Morgan
  Stanley to ""vigorously investigate, pursue and authorize any
  alternatives which would maximize the value of shareholders'
  investment in the company,"" the company said.
      Among the alternatives the special committee will consider
  are a sale of the company to a third party for more than 32
  dlrs a share, a recapitalization or restructuring, including
  self tender offers and/or asset dispositions through the use of
  dividends, Spectra-Physics said.
      The ""retention plan"" for the 52 top officers will pay an
  average bonus percentage of 28 pct of salary, it said.
      Spectra-Physics said its board approved the plan ""in order
  to encourage key operating personnel to remain with the company
  during the period of turmoil and uncertainty engendered by the
  (Ciba-Geigy) offer.""
      Under the plan, the executives would be entitled to their
  cash bonuses if they stay with the company through August 29,
  but could receive them earlier if they are fired for reasons
  other than gross and willful misconduct, or if they leave the
  company because their salaries have been sharply cut.
      Spectra-Physics also said it filed suit against Ciba-Geigy
  yesterday in U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Del., charging
  it with making a takeover bid that was false and misleading in
  violation of securities law and with violating the intent of
  July 9, 1985 standstill agreement.
      Spectra-Physics said Ciba-Geigy indicated at the time of
  the standstill agreement that it would not make an unsolicited
  takeover proposal for the company and that the intent of the
  agreement was that Ciba-Geigy would not acquire more than 20
  pct of the company unless there was another takeover threat.
      Ciba-Geigy was 18.8 pct of Spectra-Physics and Reliance
  Group Holdings &lt;REL>, which is controlled by New York investor
  Saul Steinberg, controls 12.8 pct.
      Spectra-Physics said the agreement prevents Ciba-Geigy from
  raising its stake beyond 20 pct through Jan 1, 1992, unless
  another person get more than 10 pct of its voting power.

  Saudi Arabia's renegotiation of its
  collective agreement with Aramco to purchase oil for the
  latter's ex-partners is moving along and should lead to a
  fundamental structural change in the contract, oil industry
  sources said.
      Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, in this Monday's edition,
  said negotiations are moving along for adjustment of the 1.34
  mln bpd joint long term agreement at official prices and
  volumes and other terms may be rearranged.
      The agreement signed in January for the months from
  February to June is up for renegotiation.
      Under the January contract Aramco was to purchase 1.34 mln
  bpd for the four partners allocated among them as Exxon Corp
  &lt;XON> 440,000 bpd, Texaco Inc &lt;TX> 350,000 bpd, Mobil Corp
  &lt;MOB> and Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> 550,000 bpd between them.
      But an overlifting by Texaco Inc in the first quarter
  allowed other companies like Exxon Corp to underlift its
  obligations under the contract
      PIW said that that one alternative under consideration is
  to revert to four individual contracts rather than a collective
  agrement.
      John Lichtblau, director of the Petroleum Industry Research
  Foundation Inc said that renegotiation of the pact was more of
  a formality as the Saudis have each company on a separate
  schedule although separate agreements with the companies would
  favor one on one negotiations and ensure that contracted
  liftings occur .
      ""The companies will probably follow the Saudi wants within
  limits as they do not want to antagonize them for the long
  haul,"" he said.
      Lichtblau said that the renegotiations would most likely
  concentrate on volume rather than price.
      Saudi displeasure with the agreement has long been noted
  and in April industry publications said that renegotiation were
  being sought, a fact later confirmed by Reuters with Aramco.
      Aramco Corp was formerly owned by Chevron Corp &lt;CHV>, Exxon
  Corp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp &lt;MOB> and Texaco Inc &lt;TX> but is now
  owned by Saudi Arabia which bought its assets although the
  ex-partners have various agreements with Saudi Arabia.

test/17871,"U.S. TRADE DATA SEEN AS KEY TO DOLLAR TREND
  The dollar's recent signs of stability
  have raised hopes that its 27-month decline may be nearly over,
  but most currency analysts refuse to commit themselves until
  after the June 12 release of U.S. trade data for April.
      ""The trade data will be a deciding factor to see if the
  dollar has bottomed out,"" said Jim McGroarty of Discount Corp.
      Since February 1985, the dollar has nearly halved its value
  against the yen and the mark as part of an officially
  orchestrated campaign to make U.S. goods more competitive on
  world markets and redress gaping world trade imbalances.
      On April 27, the dollar fell to a 40-year low of 137.25 yen
  but has enjoyed a modest recovery over the last few weeks,
  topping 145 yen today for the first time in nearly two months.
      Many economists now believe that the dollar has fallen far
  enough to ease the trade deficit's drag on the U.S. economy.
      The U.S. trade gap narrowed to 13.6 billion dlrs in March
  from 15.1 billion in February and is expected to show continued
  improvement in April in volume, if not in real, terms.
      Keiichi Udagawa of Bank of Tokyo in New York said that if
  further progress is reported, the dollar would head back up
  towards 150 yen.
      ""There is growing consensus that the dollar has bottomed
  out for the medium term,"" added Tom Campbell of First National
  Bank of Chicago.
      Other factors supporting this bullish view were growing
  expectations that Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker would
  be reappointed for a third four-year term in August, Japan's
  larger-than-expected economic stimulus package last week and 
  more favorably technical chart signals, analysts said.
      The dollar was also aided by Japan's moves to dampen
  speculative selling in Tokyo and by reports of active central
  bank intervention to support the dollar.
      The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said last week that
  the U.S. monetary authorities bought more than four billion
  dlrs during the February-April period -- the largest amount
  since the dollar crisis of the late 1970's.
      Discount Corp's McGroarty described the Fed's intervention
  volume as ""impressive"".
      James O'Neill of Marine Midland Bank was not so positive,
  however: ""the dollar has not yet bottomed out. After the trade
  data are released, the dollar could fall towards 1.77 marks and
  140 yen.""
      Similarly, Natsuo Okada of Sumitomo Bank in New York
  warned, ""I don't think the dollar has bottomed out yet.""
      Although the dollar could rise as high as 146.50 yen, Okada
  said market impatience about the painstakingly slow decline of
  the U.S. trade deficit may lead to renewed pressure.
      Currency analysts also warned about an unfavorable reaction
  to the seven-nation economic Summit on June 8 to 10 in Venice,
  which is likely to focus on the implementation of previous
  commitments rather than yield any fresh initiatives.
      President Reagan said today, ""economic policy decisions
  made last year in Tokyo and at this year's meetings of Group of
  Seven finance ministers in Paris and Washington cannot be
  ignored or forgotten.""
      ""The commitments made at these meetings need to be
  translated into action,"" he added in a speech, celebrating the
  40th anniversary of the Marshall aid plan for Europe.
      Now that Tokyo has unveiled its fiscal stimulus package,
  analysts expected Bonn and the dollar/mark rate to bear the
  brunt of U.S. calls for further action.
      Marine Midland's O'Neill said, ""pressure will build up on
  Germany to take stimulative action like Japan.""
      Some Japanese bank dealers warned that although the dollar
  could hold above 145 yen for some months it could also come
  under attack again if it seems the latest economic package is
  not having much impact on Japan's economy and its trade
  surplus. Reflecting a longer-term uncertainty, some some trust
  banks and Japanese insurers are keeping their short dollar
  positons hedged against exchange losses in their foreign
  portfolios, while some others have started covering those short
  positions, Japanese bank dealers said.

  Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
  Miyazawa said the Group of Seven (G-7) countries reaffirmed
  their Paris accord on stabilising currencies to convince the
  market of their resolve.
      At a news conference after today's G-7 meeting, Miyazawa
  said the ministers and central bank governors did not believe a
  totally new statement was needed.
      The speculative selling did not reflect economic
  fundamentals, and since the fundamentals had not changed only a
  reaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed, he
  said.
      He also noted that this test of the G-7 nations resolve had
  concentrated on the yen, while other currencies, especially the
  mark, had remained stable.
      Miyazawa said any change in economic conditions since the
  Paris accord was not worth being called fundamental.
      ""As I said at a time of Louvre (agreement), the expression
  of 'current level' is rather vague idea,"" he said.
      The yen's movement in the past several weeks is within the
  range agreed in Paris in Febraury, he said.
      It was better to give a vague expression than pin-pointing
  a level, which could have an adverse impact on the market,
  Miyazawa said.
      Asked why only Japan was committed to fresh measures in the
  statement, he said Japan was exceptional among the seven
  because the yen appreciated against the dollar while other
  major currencies largely have been stable.
      He also said Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has
  justed adoped a package to reflate the economy while other
  nations are not supposed to produce new measures in a short
  period since the Paris agreement.
      Miyazawa also said the U.S. sanctions against Japanese
  semiconductor products was not discussed through the G-7
  meeting and did not affect the currency talks.
      The seven nations discussed the debt problems of developing
  countries and ways to proceed in line with the debt initiative
  outlined by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker 18 months ago.

test/16139,"TRADE ISSUES STRAINING EC'S PATIENCE WITH JAPAN
  Member states of the European
  Community are starting to run out of patience with Japan which
  they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open
  its market to imports, but as often made only minor moves.
      Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC
  countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the
  willingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanese
  government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC.
      However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, as
  EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan.
      Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to
  an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could
  raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S.
  Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17.
      The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations
  entered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designed
  to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of
  the U.S.
      The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's
  trade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in
  March, up from 1.94 billion in February.
      In 1986, Japanese exports to the EC totalled 30.67 billion
  dlrs, up 4.5 pct from 1985, while EC exports to Japan fell one
  pct to 12.43 billion dlrs.
      In Paris, trade minister Michel Noir said France has
  decided to give Japan a taste of its own medicine.
      Burgeoning imports of microwave ovens and of frozen
  Coquilles St Jacques will be restricted by a strict application
  of French quality standards -- something EC states say often
  happens to their own exports entering Japan.
      Britain has threatened to withdraw the licences of Japanese
  banks and insurance companies to operate in the City of London,
  because the British Cable and Wireless company lost out in
  competition for a Japanese telecommucations contract.
      However, British officials in London have said that the
  government may have gone too far in implying that it would take
  immediate drastic action unless the contract was reopened.
      By contrast, West Germany, with the EC's most successful
  economy, has never threatened Tokyo with sanctions, preferring
  to rely on firm diplomacy and encouragement of its own
  industries to surmount obstacles to export to Japan.
      The EC Commission itself has switched its tactics in recent
  years, substituting general calls for action by Japan to open
  its market with specific demands for moves in key areas.
      At present, it is, for instance, pressuring Japan to end
  allegedly discriminatory taxation of imported wines and
  spirits, to ensure EC companies have a chance to win contracts
  for the building of a new international airport, and to
  simplify certification and safety checks on imported cars.
      EC officials say these tactics yield some benefits, but
  often the Japanese announce modifications of their non-tariff
  barriers which open the door to imports by only a token amount.
      They stress, however, that any action must be taken by the
  EC as a whole to stop beggar-my-neighbour action.
      One of the problems Britain could face if it were to
  withdraw licences for Japanese banks would be that the bankers
  would be welcomed with open arms in Frankfurt or Amsterdam,
  they point out.

      ""Clearly there will be a need to gauge the effect of other

test/21561,"ECONOMIST URGES MORE TAXES TO LOWER N.Z. DOLLAR
  An income tax surcharge and capital
  gains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation of
  the N.Z. Dollar, independent economist Len Bayliss said.
      Bayliss, a former economist with the Reserve Bank and the
  Bank of New Zealand, said a major depreciation is needed to
  restore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut by
  current government policies.
      The taxes would help cut the budget deficit, which in turn
  would lower the value of the N.Z. Dollar, he said in a speech.
  He added that the deficit for the year ending March 1988 could
  be much higher than the government's 1.3 billion dlr forecast.
      Since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as a
  percentage of gross domestic product, a major tax increase was
  probably unavoidable, Bayliss said.
      He would have preferred an increase in the 10 pct
  value-added goods and services tax, introduced in October 1986,
  but that would have had a short-term inflationary impact.
  Import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationary
  impact of a currency depreciation.
      The government had failed to bring inflation down despite
  lower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency, he added.
      New Zealand's inflation rate was 16.9 pct in the year to
  end-September against 18.9 pct in the year to end June.
      The major deficiency in the government's anti-inflation
  policies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates and
  insufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit, Bayliss
  said. The government had also failed to reduce overseas debt
  and debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit.
      ""The widespread belief that (New Zealand's) problems are
  going to take much longer to solve than was originally thought
  is soundly based -- primarily because the government's
  macro-economic policies have been unsuccessful,"" Bayliss said.

test/20764,"TREASURY'S BAKER UNDER FIRE FOR WALL STREET DROP
  As official Washington sought to
  restore investor confidence after Monday's Wall Street
  collapse, Treasury Secretary James Baker came under fire from
  critics who claimed he helped to precipitate the crisis.
      Baker's weekend blast at the West German Bundesbank for
  boosting interest rates seemed to signal an unraveling of an
  international accord to stabilize currency values.
      Nigel Lawson, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, was
  among those who said the treasury secretary's statements helped
  spur a wave of stock sales by making already jittery investors
  think that a clash between the two major economic powers would
  damage the world economy.
      Lawson told a London television interviewer Tuesday, ""I
  think the scale of the (stock) fall was very great. That, I
  think, was partly due to statements that have been made by
  senior figures on the other side of the Atlantic."" It was a
  dispute that should never have happened, he added.
      Although Baker appeared to patch over the rift at a
  hastily-called meeting with West German officials Monday, he  
  still faced a storm of criticism on his return to the United
  States on Tuesday. Baker cut short a long-planned trip to
  Scandinavia to return here to deal with the economic crisis.
      Said one U.S. analyst of Baker's weekend remarks, ""His
  timing could not have been worse.""
      One government bond salesman in New York said, ""He actually
  thought that yelling at the Germans, and threatening to smack
  the dollar down would work. That doesn't show much
  understanding of international monetary gamesmanship.""
      However, some analysts said West Germany's stubborn march
  toward higher interest rates may have forced Baker's hand.
      ""On the surface Baker may look responsible for this, but if
  you go back to see what caused it (unsettling of financial
  markets), it was West German policy,"" said Robert Brusca of
  Nikko Securities International in New York.
      ""All Mr. Baker did was to mention the obvious in public, so
  making him responsible for it was a little like killing the
  messenger,"" he said.
      After Monday's talks, the U.S. and West German governments
  made it clear that the Louvre currency accord, pieced together
  in Paris in February, was still in effect.
      Wall Street feared that collapse of the agreement might be
  a prelude to hyper-inflation and economic malaise similar to
  the late 1970s. Analysts believe Monday's Wall Street crash
  wiped out about 500 billion dlrs in stock values.
     Treasury sources said that Baker, already unhappy about
  Bonn's refusal to stimulate its economy in order to keep the
  global recovery moving, was angered by a Bundesbank interest
  rate boost that seemed destined to do just the opposite.
      He felt that the U.S. recovery, inching along in its 59th
  month, could no longer be the only engine of global economic
  expansion. A growing U.S. economy has been serving as a huge
  market for debtor country exports.
      Moreover, Baker, the consummate politician, was worried
  that the Republican party might face next year's presidential
  election with its main showpiece -- a vibrant economy -- badly
  tarnished.
      A rise in global interest rates might worsen the debt
  crisis and completely choke off U.S. economic growth that has
  already slowed to a tepid 3.2 pct annual rate.
      ""There's no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on the
  economy, and it's important that the psychology turn around
  quickly, or else obviously the panic will feed on itself, and
  eventually there'll be a serious price to pay economically,""
  former deputy Treasury Secretary Richard Darman said in a
  television interview.
      In many ways, the official response was mild.
      Washington was stunned by the sudden Wall Street retreat,
  with President Reagan speaking for most people by admitting
  that he was ""puzzled.""
      U.S. government sources said the secretary immediately
  returned to the Treasury to be briefed on market developments
  and, presumably, their political impact.
      For all of this, it seems unlikely that Baker's status in
  Washington will diminish because of the market fall.
      Asked by reporters if somebody's head should roll because
  of the Wall Street retreat, Texas Democratic Senator Lloyd
  Bentsen said with some irony, ""Oh, I think it's much too late to
  be doing that...You have an administration that's taken the
  attitude that we can put the country on automatic pilot and ---
  retire to the living room to take a nap. You just can't do
  that.""

test/17930,"TAIWAN CURBS INFLOWS OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE
  Taiwan's central bank announced that as
  from today the overseas foreign exchange borrowings of local
  and foreign banks would be frozen at the level they reached at
  the end of May.
      The central bank's statement added that the measure would
  be effective until the end of July.
      Bankers said the measure is designed to curb the inflow of
  foreign exchange and slow the growth of money supply. They
  added that the move, which sparked a record single day plunge
  of the local stock market, would limit their ability to lend
  foreign exchange to importers and exporters.
      Foreign exchange borrowings by local and foreign banks
  reached almost 12 billion U.S. Dlrs by the end of April,
  according to official statistics.
      Last week the central bank said that from today it would
  reduce its purchase of forward U.S. Dollars from banks to 40
  pct from 90 pct of the value of the contract. It said the move
  was needed because of ""distortions"" in the foreign exchange
  market.
      Exporters, nervous about the appreciating Taiwan dollar,
  have been heavily selling forward U.S. Dollars on the interbank
  market to avoid exchange rate losses.
      Official figures show that forward U.S. Dollar sales in May
  reached a record of almost six billion U.S. Dlrs against 5.9
  billion in April.
      All Taiwan's foreign exchange earnings must be converted
  into local dollars, boosting money supply at a time of booming
  exports. Money supply rose a seasonally adjusted 51.86 pct in
  the year to end-April, raising fears of higher inflation.
      In March the central bank clamped tight restrictions on
  remittances of foreign exchange by companies and individuals to
  Taiwan in a move to curb inflows of speculative money.
      Economists and bankers estimate that the rising value of
  the local dollar has attracted about ten billion U.S. Dlrs of
  speculative money into Taiwan since early last year. It has
  flowed in mainly from Hong Kong, Japan and the U.S..
      Since September 1985 the Taiwan dollar has risen by about
  22 pct against the U.S. Dollar.
      Bankers said the government's efforts to stabilise the
  foreign exchange market were a prelude to lifting all curbs on
  capital outflows. The central bank has said the controls will
  be dropped by the end of July or early August.
      Foreign exchange dealers said today's announcement caused
  jitters in the market with foreign and local banks making heavy
  purchases of U.S. Dollars. They said the central bank sold
  about 30 mln U.S. Dlrs.
      Taiwan's stock market plunged a record 75.53 points to
  close at 1,803.08.

  Bilzerian and from a third party which is active in the
  leveraged buyout field but which Pay N' Pak declined to
  identify.
      It said the Bilzerian proposal calls for shareholders to
  receive on a blended basis 16.67 dlrs in cash and 3.30 dlrs in
  liquidation value of cumulative exchangeable redeemable
  preferred stock for each common share.

  17.50 dlrs in cash and 2.50 dlrs in liquidation value of 13-1/2
  pct cumulative preferred.
      The company said the dividend on the preferred offered by
  Bilzerian would be set so that in the opinion his financial
  advisor and the company's financial advisor the preferred would
  trade in the public market at its liquidation value.
      Dividends on the preferred could be paid at the option of

  which is not subject to a financing condition.
      The company said dividends on the preferred being offered

  the first three years and the preferred would be redeemed in
  years 12 and 13.
      It said the second offer is contingent on the arrangement
  of financing, adding the party making the offer is confident of
  its ability to obtain the balance of the financing.
     
      Pay N' Pak said the second proposal is conditioned upon a
  satisfactory agreement with the company's management regarding
  its equity participation in the new company.
      The second party anticipates executing a letter of intent
  when it delivers its financing commitment to the Pay N' Pak
  board that would incorporate an expense reinbursement and

test/16009,"U.S. DOLLAR LOSSES PROPEL BROAD COMMODITY GAINS
  Commodities from gold to grains to
  cotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as losses
  in the U.S. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears of
  inflation and economic instability.
      Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in New
  York, where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs a
  troy ounce, and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce.
      A key factor behind the advance was anticipation that
  inflation will be the only way for the major industrial nations
  to halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar, said Steve
  Chronowitz, director of commodity research with Smith Barney,
  Harris Upham and Co., in New York.
      The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials from
  the seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed their
  commitment to support its value, and despite reports of
  intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, traders said.
      Traders said it appears that the industrial nations, known
  as the Group of Seven, lack the ability to change the long-term
  direction of the currency markets.
      ""Maybe they have some ideas or plans,"" said Chronowitz. ""If
  they do, it's not evident.""
      ""It looks like there's no cure but to let the free market
  take values to where they should be.
      ""One way or another, we will force our major trading
  partners to stimulate their economies,"" as a measure to correct
  the mounting U.S. trade deficit, Chronowitz said.
      ""I think the markets believe, and have believed for a long
  time, that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It's
  going to be a long and tedious process, but that's what's
  happening,"" he said.
      The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commodities
  cheaper for foreign buyers, stimulating demand.
      At the same time, traders who are holding stocks and bonds
  saw the value of their investments falling and many are turning
  to commodities such as precious metals as a hedge, said Marty
  McNeill, a metals analyst in New York with the trading house of
  Dominick and Dominick.
      The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughout
  the commodities markets, as grains, livestock, and cotton
  posted broad gains.
      Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in the
  grain markets has shifted from concern about burdensome
  supplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulate
  export demand.
      After the close of trading, the Agriculture Department
  raised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union by
  two mln tonnes from the month-earlier report.
      Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on the
  Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while live cattle were moderately
  higher.
      Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices. They said
  hogs haven't been making the weight gains that are normal at
  this time of year, and farmers have been too busy with field
  work to market animals.

  The State Department says many U.S.

  retaliation from Iran for Monday's attack on two Iranian oil
  platforms by American forces in the Gulf.
      At the same time, the Pentagon announced on Tuesday that
  U.S. forces have begun escorting another Kuwaiti tanker convoy
  southward through the Gulf from Kuwait.
      The State Department renewed its warning to Americans not
  to travel to Iran because of what spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley
  called, ""its virulent anti-American policies and support for
  terrorism.""
      ""The threat to Americans has increased significantly,"" she
  said in announcing that the department was reiterating advice
  it last made in January. The department said about 2,600
  American citizens live in Iran, the overwhelming majority dual
  nationalities.
      Oakley said no specific warning has been issued to U.S.
  diplomats and Americans living abroad in the aftermath of the
  U.S. attack on the oil drilling platforms, but ""many of our

  Unocal Corp said it told the U.S.
  Treasury Department that it will not include fluidized bed
  combustion technology, a method for the more efficient burning
  of solids, at its Parachute Creek oil shale project in Colorado
  due to high costs.
      Under a 1985 agreement with the now-defunct U.S. Synthetic
  Fuels Corp, Unocal said it would study using the technology at
  the oil shale plant. In return the company would have been
  eligible for 500 mln dlrs in loan gaurantees and price supports
  from the U.S. Treasury Department, which took over the contract
  from the Synthetic Fuels Corp, Unocal said.
      Unocal said its studies showed the cost for the fluidized
  bed combustion facility would have exceeded 352 mln dlrs,
  compared with an original estimate of 260 mln dlrs.
      The fluidized bed facility would have provided heat and
  electricity for the oil shale project, Unocal said.
      Last year's fall in oil prices and the loss of investment
  tax credit under the Tax Reform Act made the project
  uneconomical even with government price supports and loan
  guarantees, Unocal said.
      The Parachute Creek oil shale plant produces about 4,000 to
  5,000 barrels per day of crude shale oil, Unocal said.

  York.
      The central bank bought dollars through Tokyo brokers just
  before and after the market opening, the dealers said.
      The intervention took place when the dollar fell to 143.20
  yen, one dealer said.
      The dollar opened at 1.8155/60 marks against 1.8187/97 in
  New York.
      The dollar fell as low as 142.90 yen despite central bank
  intervention at 143.00 yen, dealers said.
      Selling pressure was strong from securities houses and
  institutional investors in hectic and nervous trading on
  underlying bearish sentiment for the dollar, they said.
      Most dealers were surpised by the dollar's sharp fall
  against the yen in New York, although many had expected such a
  drop to happen eventually.
      Institutional investors are expected to sell the dollar
  aggressively if it rises to around 143.50 yen, dealers said.

  A British minister said he had given the
  Japanese government a clear warning of sanctions against
  Japanese companies if Tokyo did not allow more access to its
  internal markets ""and it was clearly understood.""
      Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard said on his
  return from a visit to Japan he thought the Japanese were
  beginning to appreciate the need to be ""fair and open"" about
  access to their own markets.
      At an airport news conference Howard denied opposition
  charges that his trip had been a failure because he had
  returned empty-handed.
      ""I did what I set out to do. I was sent to deliver a clear
  message to the Japanese government, and I delivered it very
  clearly, and it has been clearly understood.""
      Howard said that under the Financial Services Act the
  govenment had considerable flexibility in taking sanctions
  against Japanese companies and finance houses operating in
  Britain.
      ""It is not simply a question of withdrawing or refusing
  operating licences. We can ban firms from certain countries
  from carrying out certain kinds of business, while allowing
  them to carry out other kinds.""
      ""I hope we don't have to use these powers, but I made it
  clear in Japan that if our timetable isn't met, we shall use
  them.""
      He said it would be unfortunate if Britain and Japan became
  involved in a tit-for-tat exchange, adding that Japan gained
  more than anyone else from an open trading relationship.
      ""I think they are beginning to appreciate that if this
  relationship is to continue, it is very important for them to
  be fair and open about access to their own markets.""
      On the question of the British firm Cable and Wireless Plc
  &lt;CAWL.L>, which is trying to win a significant share of
  telecommunications contracts in Japan, Howard said he had told
  the Japanese this was being widely regarded as a test case.
      He said there were signs of movement on the case. Cable and
  Wireless was due to take part in talks in Japan next Tuesday,
  he said.
      Earlier this week British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
  said Britain could not go it alone on sanctions against Japan,
  but would have to coordinate action with its European Community
  partners.
      Community sources said after a meeting of trade officials
  yesterday that the group might impose steep new tariffs on a
  range of Japanese goods to prevent diversion from United States
  markets if Washington imposes trade sanctions against Tokyo as
  it has threatened.

  finalised negotiations on merging oil and gas drilling tool
  activities, officials of both companies said.
      Staffan Paues, President of the new Brussels-based joint
  venture company Diamant Boart Stratabit SA (DBS), told a news
  conference that the merged firm would be able to offer products
  for all types of drilling operations.
      He said there were already signs that a slow recovery from
  recession was under way in the oil and gas industries.
      ""Stability in oil prices should lead to renewed investment""
  Paues said.
      DBS, which Paues said began operations today, brings
  together Sandvik's wholly-owned U.S. Subsidiary Strata Bit Corp
  of Houston and Diamant Boart's petroleum activities in Europe,
  North America, the Middle and Far East and Africa.
      Paues said the merger was a direct result of the sharp fall
  in oil prices 18 months ago which led oil firms to cut back
  exploration activities. Officials said the complementary
  character of the two firms' operations was a further reason.

test/18625,"NEW ZEALAND BUDGET FORECAST SEEN AS POSITIVE
  Analysts said they were surprised at
  the government's announcement of a forecast budget surplus for
  fiscal 1988 but said it was consistent with previous policy
  statements and positive for the economy.
      Finance Minister Roger Douglas predicted a budget surplus
  for the year ending March 1988 of 379 mln New Zealand dlrs
  against a 1.95 billion deficit last year.
      Analysts polled by Reuters said the forecast budget surplus
  was even more positive than the most bullish analysts'
  forecasts and that this was good news for financial markets.
      Market expectations among analysts questioned by Reuters
  before the budget varied widely between a balanced budget and a
  2.3 billion dlr deficit. But none predicted a surplus.
      The forecast initially looks positive for both the bond and
  the foreign exchange markets, one analyst said. Paradoxically,
  the New Zealand dollar could rise in the medium term, despite
  lower interest rates, as overseas investors became more
  confident about investing in New Zealand, he said.
      However, some foreign exchange dealers disagreed, saying
  the local dollar is primarily interest rate driven and will
  move lower.
      The local dollar dropped to 0.5940/50 U.S. Dlrs in after
  hours trading, against 0.5970/77 just before the budget
  release.
      Analysts said the budget was also positive for the share
  market, despite an increase in the contribution of company
  taxation to revenue figures.
      One equities analyst predicted that the budget surplus
  announcement could push the share market up by 50 points
  tomorrow.
      The Budget statement was broadly as expected, with a
  continuation of existing policies, and the absence of
  traditional pre-election incentives would be viewed positively
  by overseas investors, another said.
      But one merchant bank economist said that certain anti-tax
  avoidance measures could damage some sectors of the share
  market, particularly multi-national companies.
      The government is also lowering its borrowing requirements,
  through bond tenders, as a result of the surplus. The
  requirement for the rest of the year is now down to 950 mln
  N.Z. Dlrs from a predicted 1.75 billion.
      Predicted revenue in the Budget looked sustainable and
  there appeared to be no holding back on expenditure, another
  economist said. He added that the document seemed entirely
  credible.
      ""Altogether it looks good for Labour's election prospects,""
  he said.
      An election is due before the end of September.

  The official Soviet news agency Tass
  denounced a U.S. Attack on an Iranian oil-drilling platform in
  the Gulf on Monday as military adventurism and said it would
  bring no dividends to the Reagan administration.
      Tass commentator Mikhail Krutikhin said the administration
  had embarked on an adventurist path in order to deflect
  attention from the scandal in which the United States sold arms
  to Iran and the profits were diverted to Nicaraguan rebels.
      ""The confrontation is a fact now. What is obvious is that
  the latest military adventure will not bring political
  dividends to the American administration,"" Krutikhin said.
      Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard
  Shevardnadze abruptly left a parliamentary session earlier on
  Monday, sparking diplomatic speculation that they were
  concerned with an urgent matter of foreign affairs.
      Soviet officials have previously criticized the United
  States for sending naval forces into the Gulf, saying their
  presence serves to increase tension.
      Moscow is officially neutral in the war between Iran and
  Iraq. It is a major arms supplier to Iraq but has also sought
  broader contacts with Iran in the last year.
      Krutikhin said: ""The United States has undertaken an act of
  armed aggression against Iran, the probability of which has
  long been spoken of by Washington officials.""

  Flooding in the Red River on the

  Corp &lt;ARC>, Shell Oil Co, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell
  Group &lt;RD> and Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, which is the pipeline's
  operator.
       Peter Beutel, analyst at Elders Futures Inc, said crude
  oil futures contracts on New York Mercantile Exchange rose to
  new highs this afternoon following news of the pipeline break.
      July crude futures of West Texas Intermediate traded up to
  19.60 dlrs a barrel, a rise of more than 20 cts.
      Cash market prices also firmed on the news with sellers of
  WTI raising offers to 19.60 dlrs a barrel.
      Sour crudes, which would be most affected by the pipeline
  shutdown, however, were slow to react to the news with West
  Texas Sour and Alaska North Slope holding 50 cts to one dlr a
  barrel below WTI, respectively.
      Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at
  Texaco, said the company hopes to fix the pipeline in five days
  but that will depend on when the water level of the Red River
  recedes. There is already evidence that the water level is
  dropping and it appears the rain has stopped in the area
  affecting the pipeline, Stevens said.
      He said the segment of the pipeline that was damaged was
  underground and at a distance from the Red River that flooded.
  The pipeline runs over the Red River and under the subsoil
  nearby, according to Stevens. He said some of this subsoil was
  apparently washed away.
     
      The potential for environmental damage is being downplayed
  at this time despite the volume of oil that runs through this
  line.
      Texaco's Stevens said that aerial surveillance has not
  found any crude on the water in the river or in Lake Texoma,
  which is nearby.

  net income will be reduced by about seven mln dlrs as a result.
      Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs
  of medium- and long-term debt on February 22.
      U.S. banking regulations do not require banks to stop
  accruing interest on loans until payments are 90 days overdue,
  but Bankers Trust said it acted now because of ""the high
  potential of a continued suspension that would result in
  reaching the 90-day limit in the second quarter of 1987.""
      Assuming no cash payments at current interest rates are
  received for the rest of 1987, Bankers Trust estimated that
  full-year net income would be reduced by about 30 mln dlrs.
      Bankers Trust said it assumes that debt negotiations
  between Brazil and its commercial bank lenders will lead to the
  resumption of interest payments.
      The negotiations resume in New York on Friday when central
  bank governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask banks for a

test/19432,"NEW LEADER COMING TO U.S. SEC IN CHALLENGING ERA
  President Reagan's nominee as top
  policeman for the nation's securities markets will inherit an
  agency challenged by an insider trading scandal, wild stock
  price gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from the
  globalization of financial markets.
      David Ruder, a 58-year-old Republican law professor at
  Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., was named Thursday
  to be the 23rd chairman of the five-member U.S. Securities and
  Exchange Commission.
      If confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he will succeed
  John Shad, who left the agency earlier this week after a record
  six years as chairman to become ambassador to the Netherlands.
      The SEC has been in the limelight for the past year as its
  investigators have probed into the most colossal insider
  trading scandal ever uncovered on Wall Street.
      The investigation, which is still active, mushroomed in
  recent months as a growing number of well known traders and
  prominent investment banking firms have been charged with
  wrongdoing.
      The pace of the probe picked up markedly in November after
  Ivan Boesky, one of Wall Street's most successful stock
  speculators, agreed to cooperate with government investigators
  and to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegal
  profits after being charged with insider trading.
      But the agency is also wrestling with a vexing new
  phenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices, spurred by
  computer-driven trading strategies that span markets in 
  securities, options and futures. The price gyrations have
  combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented
  volatility to some U.S. securities markets.
      At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by some
  lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate
  takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers
  steadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape.
      And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreign
  exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork
  for an international securities marketplace in which trading
  occurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock.
      Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment
  opportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforce
  U.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud.
      Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financial
  disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies,
  eliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted to
  spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency's
  review of hostile corporate takeovers.
      Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Hutton
  investment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective to
  the agency upon being named chairman in 1981.
      In line with the views of other top administration
  officials, he favored marketplace determination of takeover
  battles over new federal regulations.
      The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insider
  trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that
  topped the agency's enforcement agenda during the
  administration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat.
      Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with
  Ruder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely to
  significantly alter the commission's current priorities.
      The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of them
  lawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that
  figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the
  agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff.
      The agency is one of the few in the government that
  actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past
  few years because of fees it charges public companies,
  investment banks and other securities firms it regulates.
      The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency,
  meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the
  president to fixed five-year terms and protected from firing
  for policy differences alone.
      By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the same
  political party, and the agency prepares its own budget request
  each year instead of leaving this to the White House.
      Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its origins
  to the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributed
  in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted
  market manipulations by large investment firms.
      The agency requires public companies and investment
  vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on
  their financial condition and to disclose changes in their
  condition any time they issue new securities.
      It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks to
  register with it and comply with investor protection rules, and
  it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices.
      Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrial
  magnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later to
  become the nation's 35th president.
      Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who served
  from 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in
  1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon's
  first term and was Reagan's director of the Central
  Intelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.

test/15939,"U.S. OIL DEPENDENCY SEEN RISING TO RECORD LEVEL
  The United States' dependency on
  foreign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s,
  according to John H. Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry
  Research Associates.
      Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conference
  here, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as much
  as 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous high
  level of 47 pct in 1977.
      ""The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is
  inevitable,"" Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oil
  imports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said.
      Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for
  33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to
  40 pct by 1990.
      ""However, the rate of this growth can be affected
  positively or negatively through government action or
  inaction,"" Lichtblau said.
      He said that one of the government's negative actions is
  the maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a
  disincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash
  flow for oil exploration.
      Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor
  price for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices.
      ""An international floor price adopted by all or most
  industrial countries would clearly be a much more effective
  measure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than if
  we imposed it alone,"" Lichtblau said.
      Development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic
  fuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessen
  U.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said.
      A potential for alternative supplies could limit the
  willingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said.
      Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer
  tax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the Strategic
  Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans
  for alternative energy.

  Japan must try harder to reduce its trade

  Economic Planning Minister Tetsuo Kondo.
      He told a press luncheon he hoped Japan could cut its
  current account surplus by some 10 billion dlrs a year until it
  is reduced to some 50 to 60 billion dlrs. In the fiscal year
  ended March 31 the surplus totalled 93.76 billion dlrs, or

      The 6,000 billion yen economic stimulation package the

  The current crude oil price of between

  of years, rising only one to two dlrs a barrel per annum to
  keep up with inflation, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman said.
      Lukman, who was speaking during talks with Swedish trade
  officials, said the stable price depended upon output restraint
  by both OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers, Swedish government
  officials said.
      They said Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, made
  the remarks whilst talking about the connection between Third
  World debt and industrialised nations.
      Crude oil output controls did not necessarily mean higher
  energy bills for the world's industrial nations, Lukman said.
      Although very low oil prices, such as those seen around the
  beginning of the year, may appear beneficial for the industrial
  countries that depend on imported energy, they would only lead
  to wastage and overdependence on the fuel in the long term, he
  said.
      This in turn would bring a swing back to extremely high
  prices, he added.
      Sweden, heavily dependent on imported oil, suffered a major
  crisis in the mid-1970s, when oil prices spiralled.

  U.S. District Court Judge Eugene
  A. Gordon said he will decide ""in the next few days"" whether to
  grant Burlington Industries Inc's request to stop a takeover by
  Samjens Acquisition Corp.
      ""I do not know how I come down on this preliminary
  injunction,"" Gordon said after listening to arguments by
  attorneys for 1-1/2 days.
      ""It's been a long time since I was deluged with as much
  information as I have been. I have to consider what's been
  presented and issue an opinion on this. Both sides cannot be
  winners,"" he said.
      Burlington requested the injunction to stop a takeover
  effort by Samjens, claiming the partnership used illegally
  obtained confidential information about the company to make its
  offer. It also alleges there would be anti-trust violations if
  Samjens, formed by Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of
  Canada, were to succeed.
      Samjens last week topped a 76 dlr per share offer for
  Burlington from Morgan Stanley Group &lt;MS> by one dlr per share.
  Morgan Stanley made its 2.44 billion dlr bid after Samjens bid
  72 dlrs per share for Burlington.
      Burlington lawyers told the court if the injunction is not
  granted Samjens would win control of Burlington. A Samjens
  lawyer argued that if the judge granted the injunction it would
  ""kill the offer""
      Jay Greenfield, an attorney for Samjens, said the
  partnership would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction
  were granted. ""There's only one Burlington,"" he said. ""If we
  cannot get that then no amount of money can compensate us.""
      Greenfield also said Samjens could sell its holdings in
  Burlington for 95 mln dlrs. ""We don't want that. We're not in
  this for the money,"" he said.
      Irving Nathan, a Burlington lawyer, reiterated that
  information provided by James Ammeen, a former Burlington
  executive, was crucial to Dominion's decision to attempt o
  takeover of Burlington.
      ""Dominion relied on the information provided by the insider
  Jim Ammeen,"" Nathan said.
      An attorney for Ammeen, who is named as a defendant, asked
  the court to dismiss the lawsuit against his client. The judge
  said he would not rule on the request today.

  The Ministry of International Trade and

  energy demand, ministry officials said.
      MITI is expected to lower the projection for primary energy
  supplies in the year 2000 to 550 mln kilolitres (kl) from 600
  mln, they said.
      The decision follows the emergence of structural changes in
  Japanese industry following the rise in the value of the yen
  and a decline in domestic electric power demand.
      MITI is planning to work out a revised energy supply/demand
  outlook through deliberations of committee meetings of the
  Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, the officials said.
      They said MITI will also review the breakdown of energy
  supply sources, including oil, nuclear, coal and natural gas.
      Nuclear energy provided the bulk of Japan's electric power
  in the fiscal year ended March 31, supplying an estimated 27
  pct on a kilowatt/hour basis, followed by oil (23 pct) and
  liquefied natural gas (21 pct), they noted.

  The European Community launched an
  investigation into allegations of dumping by Japanese
  semiconductor makers in a move which diplomats said could mark
  an intensification of world trade strains.
      Tokyo already faces a deadline of April 17 from Washington
  for the imposition of 300 mln dlrs worth of tariffs on chips it
  imports into the U.S.
      The EC Executive Commission said today the European
  Electrical Component Manufacturers Association complained that
  Japanese firms were selling high capacity EPROM type (erasable
  programmable read only memory) chips at unfairly low prices.
      Japan last year took 78 pct of the 170 mln dlr EC EPROM
  market, up from 60 pct in 1984. The EC firms said they had been
  forced to offer their products at a discount of up to 30 pct in
  order to compete with the Japanese.
      The Commission said it believed the Association had given
  sufficient elements of proof for dumping to warrant an
  investigation, which could lead it to impose duties if it found
  the complaints were justified.
      The Commission claims last year's accord between the U.S.
  And Japan on microchip pricing gives U.S. Firms privileged
  access to the Japanese market.

  The U.S. Agriculture Department
  increased its estimate of 1986/87 grain purchases by the Soviet
  Union to 28 mln tonnes, up two mln tonnes from last month.
      In its monthly report on the Soviet grain situation, the
  USDA said imports will be higher than earlier estimated because
  Soviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the last
  month.
      USDA said the increased purchasing is ""somewhat surprising""
  because of recent higher Soviet crop estimates.
      All of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn,
  USDA said.
      Of the 28 mln tonnes total, 15 mln tonnes will be wheat, 12
  mln tonnes coarse grains, and the remaining one mln tonnes
  miscellaneous grains and pulses, USDA said.
      USDA noted that the Soviet winter grain crop suffered
  through a severe winter and spring field work has been delayed.
      The severe winter ""is believed to have resulted in above
  average winter-kill,"" USDA said.
      Some grain trade analysts have said abnormal winter losses
  maybe one reason why the Soviet Union has been actively buying
  grain recently.
      USDA said Moscow already has purchased over 25 mln tonnes
  grain for delivery in 1986/87, including 14 mln tonnes wheat
  and 12 mln tonnes coarse grain.

test/17986,"CSR SAYS IT IS PROCEEDING WITH OFFER FOR MONIER
  CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S> intends to proceed with
  its planned bid for building materials group Monier Ltd
  &lt;MNRA.S> despite the counter-bid from &lt;Equiticorp Tasman Ltd>
  (ETL), CSR executive director Gene Herbert told Reuters.
      ETL said today it would offer 4.15 dlrs each for Monier's
  issued capital of 156.28 mln shares, plus a share alternative.
  This compares with a 3.80 dlr cash element in CSR's proposed
  bid.
      The proposed offer by ETL, controlled by New Zealand
  entrepreneur Allan Hawkins, came after it built up a 14.99 pct
  stake in Monier in a 95 mln dlr share raid in recent days.
  
      Herbert said Britain's Redland Plc &lt;RDLD.L>, which holds
  just under 50 pct of Monier, still supported the CSR bid and
  had told CSR it is not a seller.
      He said Redland wanted to maintain and build on its
  operations in Australia and the U.S., Where Monier has built up
  a strong presence, notably in roofing tile manufacture.
      The CSR offer contains a put and call option agreement with
  Redland. This enables Redland to accept the CSR bid within six
  months of its close or to lift its stake to 50.1 pct in the
  same period and to run Monier as a joint venture with CSR.
      CSR has said that Redland will take up the second option.
  
      ETL has declined to say why it intervened in Monier, beyond
  describing it as a long term investment.
      ETL would bring no synergies to Monier, unlike CSR which is
  a leader in building materials, Herbert said.
      ""We fit better with Monier,"" he said.
      CSR has said that it will concentrate development on its
  core businesses of sugar and building materials after its moves
  into energy several years ago.
      Asked what he thought ETL's bid sought to achieve, Herbert
  said: ""I'm puzzled as to what Hawkins' strategy is. One has to
  wonder if Monier is the main target.""
  
      Herbert said CSR had no plans to raise its bid, and said a
  higher price would be difficult to justify on fundamentals.
      Monier was trading at 2.80 dlrs when CSR launched its
  original bid of 3.50, or 16.8 times earnings, in late April.
      The shares closed at 3.90 dlrs today, down 25 cents on
  yesterday, after ETL withdrew on reaching the top foreign
  shareholding level permitted without Foreign Investment Review
  Board (FIRB) approval. Its bid is subject to FIRB approval.
      Herbert also said that institutions, which are more likely
  to accept a share alternative than cash, would have to judge
  the respective values of ETL and CSR shares.
  
      ETL is the third group to become involved in a possible
  acquisition of Monier this year. Redland held discussions on a
  possible takeover before the CSR bid emerged but the
  negotiations foundered on the price.
      Share analysts said that for this reason, they did not
  think ETL's intervention would flush out a full Redland bid
  although Monier's ultimate fate rests in its hands.
      ""Redland is still in the driving seat,"" said Tim Cohen of
  &lt;Ord Minnett Ltd>, adding that Redland would be happier having
  CSR as a partner in running Monier than ETL.
      Monier's independent directors have recommended ETL's bid.

  Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter
  said on Monday that the U.S. free trade agreements with Canada
  and Israel should help to pave the way for liberalizing the
  global trading system.
      He said the Canadian and Israeli pacts will not set back
  worldwide reform efforts under the General Agreement on Tariffs
  and Trade (GATT) as some critics feared but help them.
      The GATT talks began a year ago in Punta del Este, Uruguay
  to liberalize the global trading system and to include in it
  trade in agriculture and services such as banking.
      Yeutter made his remarks at a U.S.-Israeli trade meeting
  marking the second year of their bilateral accord. The
  Canadian-U.S. pact, signed by two sides two weeks ago, has yet
  been approved by the U.S. Congress and Canadian Parliament.
      The two free trade agreements (FTA) would gradually remove
  tariffs and other barriers to cross-border trade in goods and
  many services.
      Yeutter said in the aftermath of the Canadian and Israeli
  pacts ""other countries have realized that if they want to
  continue to have access to the world's largest market, they had
  better get serious about improving the GATT.""
      The pact with Israel, he said, is gradually increasing
  shipments both ways and the Canadian pact will substantially
  increase the gross national products in both countries.
      Yeutter also said the Canadian and Israeli pacts should
  serve as important precedents for progress in GATT.
      Yeutter said, ""increasing trade is one of the keys to
  enhanced political and economic stability around the globe.""
      He said, ""a stronger GATT will enhance prosperity, not only
  for advanced industrial nations, but also for other countries
  that need to increase trade in order to better their standards
  of living.""
      Yeutter added it was important not to risk the progress
  made in the Israeli and Canadian trade pacts by resorting to
  protectionism.
      He was referring to trade legislation pending in Congress
  that would force the United States to take retaliatory actions
  against nations with large trade surpluses with the United
  States if the countries practiced unfair trade.
      The legislation was prompted by a growing U.S. trade
  deficit that hit 156 billion dlrs last year and is still
  rising.
      Yeutter said the pressures for Congress to act were hard to
  resist, but the pending legislation would undermine President
  Reagan's efforts to liberalize the world trade.
      Yeutter renewed the threat of a White House veto.
      He said, ""President Reagan will veto any bill that contains
  serious flaws, and I believe that veto would be sustained.""

  General Electric Corp said its
  first quarter results were significantly higher due to the
  strong results of RCA, which was acquired last year.
      General Electric also attibuted continued strong
  performances in plastics, major appliances and the Employers
  Reinsurance Corp for its strong quarter.
      GE recorded net earnings for the first quarter 1987 of 624
  mln dlrs, or 1.37 dls per shr, up 16 pct from 537 mln dlrs, or
  1.18 dlrs per share for the same quarter a year ago.
      General Electric chairman John Welch Jr reiterated the
  company's outlook for 1987 in which it expects double-digit GE
  earnings growth for the year. He said the first quarter results
  are in line with those expectations.
      General Electric cited the strong results in TV network and
  station operations of the National Broadcasting Co, which was
  not part of GE in the first quarter of 1986, as one reason for
  its strong earnings.
      It also noted that aircraft engine operating profit was
  much higher than a year ago, caused by a increase in shipments
  than the 1986 quarter, which was impacted by a strike.
      Aerospace revenues were sharply higher in this year's first
  quarter from a year ago, mainly because of the inclusion of
  RCA's aerospace and defense business, the company said.
      In addition, consumer products revenues were up from last
  year, mainly because of including sales of RCA video products.
      General Electric said restructuring provisions of 308 mln
  dlrs before taxes to implement various strategic moves were
  charged against operations in the first quarter of 1987. It
  added that there was a one-time gain of 281 mlns dlrs after
  taxes from an inventory accounting change.
      And technical products revenues and operating profit were
  ahead of last year, led by a strong increases in medical
  systems volume and the inclusion this year of RCA's
  communications and related services.

  Treasury Secretary James Baker said

      In remarks before the IMF's policy-making Interim
  Committee, Baker reiterated a Group of Seven statement last
  night that the substantial exchange rate changes since the
  Plaza agreement 18 months ago have ""now brought currencies
  within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals.""
      Baker said, ""These exchange rate shifts have generally been
  orderly, and have improved prospects for the reduction of
  external imbalances to more sustainable levels.""
      As they are today, the trade and current account imbalances
  ""simply are not sustainable,"" Baker told the ministers.
      He said that the Reagan administration was resisting ""strong
  domestic pressure"" for trade protection and was working closely
  with the U.S. Congress in crafting a trade bill.
      ""While we cannot yet be sure of the outcome, we are doing
  what we can to ensure that the bill is not protectionist,"" he
  said.
      Baker also urged the International Monetary Fund's
  executive board to review possible modifications to the Fund's
  compensatory financing facility before the annual meeting this
  fall.
      ""We should pay particular attention to the lack of
  continuing conditionality associated with the use of the CFF

  President Reagan said he would discuss
  the Mideast Gulf situation with allied leaders at next week's
  Venice economic summit and hinted he would seek their help in
  preserving free navigation.
      In a speech prepared for delivery as the United States made
  plans to protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers from Iranian attack,
  Reagan said the American people were aware that ""it is not our
  interests alone that are being protected.""
      Saying that allied dependence on gulf oil was no secret,
  Reagan declared, ""During the upcoming summit in Venice, we will
  be discussing the common security interests shared by the
  western democracies in the MIDEAST Gulf.
      ""The future belongs to the brave. Free men should not cower
  before such challenges, and they should not expect to stand
  alone.""
      Reagan will meet the leaders of Britain, France, West
  Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan at the economic summit, which
  will take place in Venice June 8-10.
     
      The 13th annual top-level meeting of the major industrial
  democracies will take place against a backdrop of rising
  congressional concern over Reagan's plan to protect gulf
  shipping and demands that the allies do more.
       These concerns were heightened by the May 17 Iraqi missile
  attack on the U.S. frigate Stark which killed 37 seamen.
      ""They died while guarding a chokepoint of freedom, deterring
  aggression and reaffirming America's willingness to protect its
  vital interests,"" Reagan said.
     
      In a pre-summit speech celebrating the 40th anniversary of
  the Marshall Plan, Reagan, who spoke to an audience of foreign
  affairs experts, also pledged to push for economic expansion by
  West Germany and Japan to bolster the world trading system.
      ""While the vibrancy of the U.S. economy has contributed
  enormously to the world expansion, preserving a growing world
  economy is the business of every member of the world trading
  community,"" he said.
     
      ""It will be made clear, especially to our friends in Japan
  and the Federal Republic of Germany, that growth-oriented
  domestic policies are needed to bolster the world trading
  system on which they depend.""
      Reagan coupled this appeal with a call for compliance with
  allied accords on exchange rate stability.
      ""Economic policy decisions made last year in Tokyo and at
  this year's meetings of Group of Seven finance ministers in
  Paris and in Washington cannot be ignored or forgotten,"" he
  said. ""The commitments made at these meetings need to be
  translated into action.""

  South Yemen is planning a major oil

  Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) said.
      MEES said government approval for the export pipeline
  followed a visit to Aden by a high ranking delegation from the
  Soviet Union, which will help South Yemen construct the line
      The engineering studies for the pipeline are nearly
  finished and construction is expected to start early next year,
  the industry newsletter said.
      The pipeline will run about 170-200 kms (105-125 miles)
  from Shabwa oilfields to a coastal terminal at Bir 'Ali on the
  Gulf of Aden, MEES said.
       MEES said the Soviet firm Technoexport, which is
  developing oilfileds for South Yemen, has substantially
  increased its initial reserve estimates and recommended a
  pipeline with an eventual 500,000 bpd capacity.
      The discovery of commercial quaotities of oil was confirmed
  by Technoexport earlier this year in three structures in the
  Shabwa region in the Northwestern part of the country, 200 kms

  Iran's top war spokesman Ali Akbar

  its Gulf oil platforms an escalation and promised retaliation.
      ""God willing, we will carry out our duty in the coming days
  and make them sorry,"" said Rafsanjani in a speech to Parliament
  later broadcast by Tehran Radio.
      The Tehran leadership have been quick to threaten vengeance
  after the U.S. Raids on the rigs, one of which was destroyed.
      President Ali Khamenei, Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi
  and now Rafsanjani within 24 hours of the U.S. Action have all
  vowed retaliation.
      Rafsanjani, the parliamentary speaker, said, ""It is not a
  threat or an attempt at intimidation when we say we will
  respond to aggression -- it is a reality and we have proved it
  in practice."" He added that the American attack ""squares neither
  with its superpower image nor its claim of concern with
  security, nor reason and wisdom.""
      U.S. Warships shelled an Iranian offshore oil platform and
  American special forces boarded another, destroying equipment.
      The U.S. Government said the attack was a measured response
  to an Iranian missile attack on the American-flagged Kuwaiti
  tanker Sea Isle City in Kuwaiti waters last Friday.

test/18835,"EUROPEAN COMMUNITY CRITICISES U.S TRADE MEASURES
  The European Community (EC) accused the
  United States of violating a political commitment to free trade
  through practices including a tax on imported gasoline and a
  customs user fee.
      EC ambassador Tran Van-Thinh made the formal charge to the
  surveillance body of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
  (GATT), GATT spokesman David Woods told reporters.
      Woods also said the EC was joined by the United States in
  criticising Brazil for extending its list of products for which
  import licenses have been temporarily suspended, so as to
  improve its balance of payments.
      The United States charged Japan with violating GATT rules
  by restricting imports of agricultural products through an
  import licensing system. The United States asked for
  consultations with Tokyo on the issue.
      Tran charged that the trade measures contravened a
  political commitment to halt and reverse trade barriers,
  pledged by ministers in Punta del Este last September.
      When ministers established the four year Uruguay round to
  negotiate freer trade in 13 areas, they set up the GATT
  surveillance body to monitor this commitment, known in GATT
  jargon as ""standstill and rollback.""
      Tran criticised Washington for the ""superfund"" tax on oil
  imports, a customs user fee, and the removal of a special
  machine tool (known as category FSC34) from its government
  procurement list for reasons of national security.
      Warren Lavorel, a U.S. Trade official, defended the
  policies, saying they did not violate GATT trade rules.
      The surveillance body will send a record of today's talks
  to the Trade Negotiating Committee, which oversees the round,
  to decide any further action on the charges.
      The oil tax and customs user fee have already been the
  subject of formal GATT dispute panels set up outside the
  Uruguay Round to rule on the legality of the practices.
      The ruling GATT Council yesterday adopted a dispute panel's
  report and ruled that the U.S. Superfund tax on oil imports
  breached trade rules. It called on Washington to modify its
  legislation.
      Mexico and Canada, along with the European Community,
  brought the dispute to the GATT last year.

  Honeywell Inc said a gain of

      Honeywell reported 1987 first quarter operating earnings
  rose to 43.7 mln dlrs or 96 cts a share from 36.4 mln dlrs or
  79 cts in the same period a year ago.
      Better operating results in each of the company's three 
  sectors offset higher interest costs in the first quarter due
  to financing the December acquisition of Sperry Aerospace and
  the sharing of the Federal Systems subsidiary pre-tax profit
  with Honeywell Bull Inc, Honeywell said.
      ""Our first quarter results show clear benefits of our
  restructuring,"" chairman Edson Spencer said. ""All of our
  businesses are producing better results than last year, even
  though we do not see significant improvement in the external
  market environment,"" he said.
      Total orders in the first quarter were up substantially,
  with a sharp increase in aerospace and defense orders in
  addition to those of the new Sperry Aerospace group, it said.
      Domestic industrial automation and control orders were
  modestly higher than the same period in 1986, it said.
      Orders in Honeywell's home and building automation and
  control business were flat in the U.S. and up in international
  markets, it said.
      International orders increased, with the greatest strength
  in Europe, Honeywell said.
      The company said that by year-end 1987, it intends to
  complete the repurchase of 3.3 mln shares remaining of a five
  mln share buyback program which began in 1986.

test/15450,"FINANCE MINISTERS AGREE ON NEED FOR STABILITY
  Finance ministers from seven major
  industrialized nations agreed on the need to stabilize
  currencies at current levels but said more action was needed to
  reduce trade imbalances and sustain economic growth.
      In a communique issued after a four-hour meeting at the
  U.S. Treasury that ended last night, the ministers said the
  value of the dollar and other currencies was basically correct
  now, and they welcomed new measures planned by the Japanese to
  boost their economy.
      West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg called it
  a ""good meeting"" and in brief remarks exchanged with reporters
  other ministers seemed pleased with its outcome.
      Shortly after the communique was issued and just as foreign
  exchange trading opened in Tokyo, the Bank of Japan intervened
  again to prevent the yen rising too quickly.
      The communique said, ""The ministers and governors reaffirmed
  the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent
  Paris meeting. They agreed, however, that further actions will
  be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain
  global economic expansion and reduce trade imbalances.""
      It welcomed the plans set this week by the Japan's ruling
  Liberal Democratic Party to stimulate its economy with what the
  communique termed ""extraordinary and urgent measures"" including
  an ""unprecedented front-end loading of public works
  expenditures.""
      The meeting of the so-called Group of Seven brought
  together ministers and central bank governors of the seven
  major industrial democracies, the United States, Japan, West
  Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.
      The communique said the ministers reaffirmed the commitment
  on cooperation reached in a meeting on February 22 in Paris
  when they had agreed to stabilize foreign exchange rates at the
  then-current levels.
      In the weeks that followed, the dollar continued to fall
  against the Japanese yen despite massive dollar purchases by
  the Bank of Japan and other central banks and is now trading at
  around postwar lows.
      Japan has come under growing criticism from both the United
  States and European countries for its only modest efforts to
  open its markets to outside competition and to reduce its
  exports.
      The communique said Japan affirmed its intention to open
  domestic markets to foreign goods and services but did not
  elaborate.
      It said the officials ""reaffirmed the view that around
  current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly
  consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy
  intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.""

test/18991,"JAPAN TRADE SURPLUS WILL GROW AGAIN IN 1987, OECD
  Japan's trade surplus is likely to
  continue to grow in 1987, as sales of Japanese goods abroad
  increase while domestic demand remains sluggish, the
  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
  said.
      In its latest half-yearly review of the world economy, the
  OECD said Japan managed to considerably reduce its surplus last
  year, when domestic demand grew by four pct in 1986 while
  export markets rose by only two pct.
      But it said this differential between the growth of
  domestic and foreign demand would reverse in 1987 and 1988,
  ""thus weakening the international adjustment process.""
      It forecast a slowing in domestic growth to little over two
  pct but with a rise in exports of 3.3 pct in 1987 and 3.6 pct
  in 1988. As a result, the current account surplus in 1987 will
  rise to 95 billion dlrs from 86 billion in 1986, although in
  1988 it should fall back to 87 billion dlrs.
      The OECD outlook did not take account of the 6,000 billion
  yen package announced last month to stimulate domestic demand
  and increase imports to Japan. However, OECD officials said the
  measures will significantly strengthen domestic demand, quite
  possibly exceeding one pct GNP when the full effects have
  worked through, and thus will provide some stimulus to imports.
      The OECD outlook said, ""Continued large current account
  surpluses and the further build-up of an already-substantial
  net external asset position could well lead to upward pressure
  on the yen."" It said that further appreciation could then lead
  manufacturers to postpone their investment plans and thus
  weaken domestic growth.
      The OECD said Japan's Gross National Product was likely to
  gorw an annual two pct in 1987 and 1988, below 1986's 2.5 pct
  growth. But it said Japan would continue its good performance
  on inflation, with a zero figure expected in 1987 compared to a
  0.6 pct rise in consumer prices last year.

test/17886,"JAPAN OIL INDUSTRY DECONTROL MAY LEAD TO MERGERS
  Deregulation of Japan's oil industry could
  mean hardship for smaller firms and lead to their merging into
  bigger refining and marketing groups, industry sources said.
      They said the relaxation of controls was now under review
  by the Petroleum Council, an advisory panel to the Ministry of
  International Trade and Industry (MITI).
      A spokesman for a major firm said, ""Deregulation would bring
  about a reorganization. If it's a by-product of freer
  competition, we have no choice but to accept it.""
      The Council is due to close its discussions on June 12.
      The sources said the Council was likely to tell MITI it
  should end its 50 year-old protection of the industry. It
  should cut capacity to 3.8 mln barrels per day, about 75 pct of
  current capacity. Quotas should end for crude throughput and
  gasoline output, and oil tariffs should be abolished.
      They said deregulation was vital to promote more
  competition and efficiency, and most saw it as inevitable.
      ""Deregulation is taking place everywhere. Now it's our turn
  to see if we can survive cut-throat competition,"" said a source
  at one major Japanese oil company.
      A spokesman for a smaller refiner said, ""We'll have a hard
  time surviving, but that's something we must go through.""
      ""In addition to our streamlining and efficiency programs for
  the oil division, we will exert efforts towards branching out
  further into other lines such as real estate and travel
  agencies,"" he said.
      Larger companies are also streamlining. Nippon Oil Co Ltd
  which had the largest share of refined products sales in the
  Japanese market in fiscal 1985, cut nine pct of its refining
  capacity in fiscal 1986.
      Cosmo Oil Co Ltd, the third largest seller of oil products
  in 1985, cut its workforce by some 20 pct last year, a
  spokesman for the company said.
      Between 1984 and 1986, on the recommendation of the
  Council, 13 oil companies were integrated into 11 companies
  within seven refining and marketing groups to improve the
  efficiency of the industry.
      Oil industry sources said this structure was now likely to
  be streamlined further into five refining groups.
      ""MITI means business. It will urge the major seven groups to
  merge into five to build up their muscles,"" a source said.
      A MITI official told Reuters he did not rule out the
  possibility of further mergers within the Japanese oil industry
  in the event of the relaxation of oil controls.
      He declined to officially confirm or deny that the
  Petroleum Council had recommended deregulatory measures but
  said that in principal MITI would encourage a move towards
  deregulation.

test/21542,"LOUVRE ACCORD STILL IN EFFECT, JAPAN OFFICIAL SAYS
  The Group of Seven (G-7) industrial nations
  still comply with last February's Louvre accord to stabilize
  currencies, a senior Bank of Japan official said.
      And U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker's remarks at the
  weekend indicating the need to revise it do not herald a lower
  range for the dollar, other senior officials from the Bank of
  Japan and Finance Ministry agreed in interviews.
      ""The exchange market is apparently reacting too much, and
  anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker comment will regret it
  later on,"" the Bank of Japan official told Reuters.
      The Bank official said Baker did not mean to talk the
  dollar down. A lower dollar would harm the U.S. Economy, he
  noted.
      A Finance Ministry official who was directly involved in
  monetary talks with other nations also said the U.S. Would
  never attempt to lower the reference range for the dollar
  against the mark or the yen.
      The market assumes the dollar reference range to be between
  140-150 yen and between 1.70 and 1.90 marks.
      The dollar closed in Tokyo today at 1.7730/35 marks and
  141.35 yen.
      ""Behind Baker's remark was U.S. Frustration over higher
  interest rates abroad, especially in West Germany, but this
  does not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework
  of the Louvre accord,"" the Finance Ministry official said.
      He said that on the contrary Baker wanted to avoid any
  further rise in U.S. Interest rates because it would not only
  hurt the U.S. Economy but aggravate the Third World debt
  problem.
      Higher U.S. Interest rates would merely raise their
  interest payment burden and depress U.S. Stock and bond markets
  further, the monetary officials said.
      Both the ministry and central bank officials, who declined
  to be named, noted the U.S. No longer wants to see a further
  decline of the dollar because that could also fan inflationary
  expectations in the U.S.
      ""That's why Baker did not fail to add that the Louvre
  agreement is still operative,"" the senior ministry official
  said.
      Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday that
  Washington would reexamine the Louvre accord because of West
  Germany's increase in short-term interest rates.
      The market at first interpreted this as indicating the U.S.
  Would be ready to scrap the Louvre accord and let the dollar
  decline further unless surplus countries, notably West Germany,
  try harder to stimulate their economies as pledged in the
  accord, foreign exchange dealers said.
      But the market on reflection also noted Baker's additional
  statement that ""the Louvre agreement is still operative,"" and
  this caused some dollar short-covering in Tokyo today, the
  dealers said.
      Uncertainty, however, remained the flavour of the day in
  Tokyo currency markets.
      The Japanese monetary officials said Baker's undisguised
  pressure on West Germany to refrain from guiding interest rates
  higher may be part of a process of multilateral surveillance,
  or international economic policy coordination.
      The G-7, comprising the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,
  France, Italy and Canada, have agreed to monitor each other's
  economic policies and from time to time apply ""peer pressure"" to
  persuade others to change their policies to a desired course,
  they noted. ""Without such a basic agreement of multilateral
  surveillance, Baker would never have criticized the West German
  policy so openly,"" the ministry official said.
      The U.S.-West German squabble over Bonn's monetary policy
  should thus be regarded as a process of healthy policy
  coordination and not as any indication of a possible collapse
  of the Louvre agreement, the official said.
      He also said Japan has not received any specific request
  from the U.S. On its monetary policy, although its short-term
  money rates have been edging higher.
      ""This is because we, unlike the Germans, are not taking
  policy to guide interest rates higher, and the marginal rate
  rise in recent days is primarily for seasonal reasons,"" he
  added.

  Donald Regan, President Reagan's

      ""I think what we have to face now is trying to preserve our
  economy,"" the one-time chairman of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc
  &lt;MER> said in an interview on the ABC television network.
      ""We've got to loosen money, we've got to keep interest rates
  down. We can't afford to let them go up. That means we're going
  to have to work on our twin deficits, both the budget deficit
  and the trade deficit,"" Regan said.

  moment,"" Regan said when asked about the prospects for a
  recession following Monday's price drop on Wall Street.
      ""I think that if they were to do that, they'd create the
  same conditions that we did in '29...They choked off the money
  supply and what happened? We went into a major recession. I
  think that's the one thing we've got to avoid right now.""
      Regan also called on the government to impose restrictions
  on program trading. ""I think that that's exacerbated,
  exaggerated this decline, and I think it's something that they

  Ceylon Petroleum Corp (CPC) has decided
  to renew its one-year contract with Abu Dhabi for 480,000
  tonnes of Upper Zakum crude oil, CPC officials told Reuters.
      They said CPC made the recommendation to the cabinet and is
  now awaiting its approval.
      CPC's one-year contract with Abu Dhabi expired on May 31
  this year and it wants the renewed contract to begin on June 1
  at the government selling price. Delivery will be determined in
  the course of the year. Last year, shipments were in three
  parcels of 120,000 tonnes each and four of 30,000 tonnes each.
      CPC officials also said the company agreed with the
  Egyptian government for the supply of 240,000 tonnes of Gulf of
  Suez crude for delivery in two shipments this year at the
  government selling price.
      Last year, CPC bought 120,000 tonnes Gulf of Suez through
  C.Itoh.
      Officials said plans to buy 240,000 tonnes of Basra Light
  from Iraq have not been finalised yet because of several
  constraints. CPC said it could not accept 120,000 tonne parcels
  and proposed to lift 30,000 tonnes in eight shipments.
      Iraq National Oil Co (INOC) told CPC a Red Sea port where
  lifting was to take place could not accept small ships. INOC
  then proposed to deliver eight shipments of 30,000 tonnes each.
      CPC said INOC planned to ship the oil to an Indian port for
  delivery of Indian requirements, later going to Colombo to
  offload CPC's needs, but CPC considered this unsuitable.
      CPC said it had not received a reply from INOC since
  December. Sri Lanka imports all its annual needs of 1.7 mln
  tonnes. This year it plans to buy 400,000 tonnes on the spot
  market compared with about 1.3 mln tonnes last year.

  quoted the figures as showing exports rose 27 pct to 7.28
  billion dlrs and imports fell 5.1 pct to 8.33 billion.
      He said if imports of gifts, foreign aid items and
  materials for joint ventures are excluded, the deficit was only
  350 mln dlrs, and the surplus on invisibles was 700 mln. As a
  result, foreign exchange reserves increased somewhat from their

      Official figures show the reserves at 10.514 billion dlrs
  at end-1986, down from 11.9 billion at end-1985.
      Zhang said one reason for the rise in exports was improved
  incentives to export firms, which are being allowed to retain
  more foreign exchange from the goods they sell.
      He said first quarter exports to Hong Kong and Macao rose
  35.5 pct to 2.48 billion dlrs and imports rose 55.3 pct to 1.46

  The Bank of Japan bought 100 billion yen
  in certificates of deposit (CDs) via repurchase agreements
  today to show its determination to maintain an easy money
  policy, central bank officials said.
      ""Today's CD buying operation was designed to seek an
  announcement effect, in which we would reassure the market of
  the fact that we have not changed our policy stance,"" a senior
  central bank official told Reuters.
      The bank also bought 400 billion yen in two-month
  commercial bills to smooth out tight credit conditions in the
  interbank market today, the officials said.
      The central bank was concerned about growing market
  expectations of higher interest rates, which were in part
  responsible for the recent plunge in stock and yen bond prices,
  the officials said.
      But money traders said the market generally shrugged off
  the bank's CD operation because it was small and at a rate far
  below prevailing market rates. The rate on the key three-month
  CDs in the primary market was 4.08/00 pct, while the bank's bid
  was 3.75 pct, they said.
      The bank's bill buying operation also had little impact
  because it was regarded as a routine operation, they said.
      The money traders said they regarded the central bank's CD
  buying operation as simply a gesture to live up to Japan's
  pledge to guide interest rates lower and stimulate the economy.
      ""We did not expect the central bank to ease its credit grip
  any further,"" a bank manager said, adding that the prevailing
  market expectation of higher rates will remain.
      ""If this is the case, the three-month CD rate will stay
  above four pct for the time being,"" he said.

  After a highly favorable reception of
  a trial batch of bread baked from 300 lbs of U.S. wheat flour
  last February, the Senegalese appear ready to take delivery of
  a first tranche of 10,500 tonnes of mixed U.S. wheat, the U.S.
  Agriculture Department said.
      In its report on U.S. Export Markets for U.S. Grain, the
  department noted Senegal had bought 100,000 tonnes of wheat
  under the Export Enhancement Program last November, but local
  opposition from millers, accustomed to French wheat, has been
  delaying deliveries.
      As a result there were a series of baking seminars as well
  as the trial batch, in an effort to satisfy local flour millers
  and convince key officials of the qualities of U.S. wheat.
      The department said if deliveries of U.S. wheat to Senegal
  remain on track, the U.S. could dominate a wheat market that
  had been expected to import 140,000 tonnes of mostly French
  wheat during the 1987/88 (July-June) season.

  The U.S. Senate on Tuesday backed
  President Reagan's retaliatory strike against Iranian targets
  in the Gulf as it moved to take a greater role in making policy
  in the volatile region.
      Senators voted 92-1 for a non-binding measure that endorsed
  Monday's U.S. attack on two Iranian oil platforms in
  retaliation for an Iranian attack last Friday on a Kuwaiti ship
  flying the American flag.
      The measure said the attack was a firm indication of U.S.
  resolve that Iran ""cannot take military action against the
  United States with impunity.""
      Earlier, the Senate cut off Republican stalling tactics and
  set a vote on a measure that could give Congress a larger role
  in making Gulf policy. The measure, however, does not require
  Reagan to comply with the 1973 War Powers Act, which could lead
  to a pullout of U.S. forces from the Gulf.
      While Democrats and Republicans praised the U.S.
  retaliatory strike, many voiced new fears about the growing
  U.S. involvement in the Gulf and some demanded that Reagan
  comply with the War Powers Act.

  Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd
  &lt;JARD.HK> said it will withdraw the previously announced

      A statement said the firm expects to pay total dividends
  for 1987 of not less than 40 cents a share on the expanded
  capital.
      Jardine Matheson decided to withdraw its issue because of a
  joint announcement earlier today by Ronald Li, chairman of the
  Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, and Securities Commissioner Ray
  Astin, that the listings of new ""B"" shares would be barred.
      The official announcement said this will include the
  proposal by Jardine Matheson.
      But the Jardine statement quoted chairman Simon Keswick as
  saying: ""We continue to believe that the issuing of ""B"" shares
  would benefit shareholders, and regret that they will not be
  given the opportunity to vote on the matter at this stage.""
      Keswick said the ""B"" share issue will benefit Jardine
  Matheson's shareholders by giving the firm flexibility to issue
  ordinary shares for expansion in future without diluting
  existing shareholders' voting rights.
      However, he added: ""We certainly welcome (the Secretary for
  Monetary Affairs) David Nendick's referral of this very
  important matter to the Standing Committee on Company Law
  Reform and are hopeful that the process will lead to the
  development of general principles which can be embraced by all

  Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
  said the ruling of a GATT panel on a U.S. trade complaint
  against Japan, expected soon, may influence the U.S. stance in
  negotiations with Tokyo on beef and citrus import quotas.
      The ruling of a GATT tribunal on a U.S. demand that Japan
  end quotas on 12 categories of food items is expected by the
  end of the year. Lyng said he is optimistic the ruling will
  favor the U.S.
      ""These are quota items, and the principles that apply to
  them, it seems to me, will have some bearing on the question of
  whether you would have quotas or not on beef and citrus,"" Lyng
  told Reuters in an interview.
      He repeated the U.S. demand that Japan lift the quotas on
  beef and citrus after March 31, next year.
      The Japanese quotas on 12 food categories which the United
  States has challenged include items such as tomato paste, some
  cheeses and specialty fruit juices.
      U.S. officials had hoped a ruling against the quotas would
  be issued earlier this year but the GATT panel decision has
  been delayed by the illness of the tribunal's chairman.
      The U.S. has taken a hardline stance on the beef and citrus
  quotas, which Tokyo says must remain in place to protect
  Japanese farmers.
      ""We will not negotiate new quotas or accept new quotas (on
  beef and citrus). If they impose them we would consider that an
  illegal action in the GATT, Lyng said.
      He declined to say what action the U.S. would take next
  April if Japan continues to resist U.S. demands.

test/17915,"POEHL LOOKS SET FOR EIGHT MORE YEARS AT BUNDESBANK
  For currency dealers Karl Otto Poehl is
  the scourge of speculators, for bankers he is the man who has
  played a key role in shaping the world's financial destiny for
  the last seven years, and for Germans he is the guardian of the
  mark.
      President of the powerful and independent West German
  central bank, the Bundesbank, Poehl is likely to have his
  contract renewed for another eight years when it expires at the
  end of this year, government officials say.
      (Index of economic spotlights, see page ECRA)
      But no official announcement has yet been made, raising
  eyebrows in West Germany's business community.
      The ebullient Poehl spent seven years in Bonn in top
  ministerial posts under the Social Democrats, now in
  opposition, before he moved to the Bundesbank.
      There has been speculation that Chancellor Helmut Kohl
  would try to replace Poehl with a man closer to his own
  Christian Democrats. But officials noted that Poehl has worked
  closely and successfully with Finance Minister Gerhard
  Stoltenberg since Kohl's government took office in 1982.
      Poehl, the most senior central banker apart from Paul
  Volcker of the United States, enjoys a strong international
  reputation which it would take a newcomer years to build up.
      Given these circumstances, Kohl will probably overlook
  Poehl's past as an adviser to former Social Democrat Chancellor
  Willy Brandt, and top aide to Helmut Schmidt when he was
  Finance Minister, bankers said. It was Schmidt who, as
  Chancellor, appointed Poehl to his present job in 1980.
      In recent months, with the mark's strong rise against the
  dollar, Poehl has made exchange rates the central concern of
  the Bundesbank's council, a highly conservative institution
  which has doggedly pursued monetary policies to prevent
  inflation catching hold. Older Germans can remember two bouts
  of galloping inflation this century.
      But with consumer prices falling for much of 1986, and
  inflation negligible so far this year, Poehl thinks it is safe
  to relax the monetary reins a little and concentrate on the
  dangers to the German economy of a bloated exchange rate.
      ""I am of the opinion that efforts to stabilise the
  dollar/mark rate have reached a high priority, also for the
  Bundesbank, because a further massive revaluation of the mark
  would endanger the economy in West Germany,"" he told business
  journalists in Frankfurt recently.
      Ute Geipel, head of research at Citibank AG, says that
  Poehl's reappointment would guarantee flexible monetary policy.
      ""Poehl's policy has always been a policy which does not
  focus so rigidly on domestic factors, but also on the external
  economy,"" she said.
      An economist at a German bank, who declined to be
  identified, said ""If Poehl is confirmed in his post, it will
  certainly be a plus for the pragmatic course which is not so
  rigidly oriented towards money supply.""
      One of Poehl's great struggles recently has been to
  persuade the United States to stop ""talking down"" the dollar. For
  Poehl, the significance of the February Louvre Accord was that
  the United States agreed to join efforts to stabilise
  currencies.
      The Louvre Accord was greeted with scepticism by currency
  dealers who said they would soon put it to the test. But in
  fact the dollar has been relatively stable since the pact.
      ""This is because the markets know - or perhaps because they
  don't know - what the central banks can do,"" Poehl says of
  intervention in currency markets which can quickly turn rates
  round, making a speculator's position worthless.
      Poehl was born in 1929 and worked as a financial journalist
  in the 1960s before starting his ministerial career.
      A relaxed sun-tanned figure who enjoys cracking jokes over
  a glass of beer, he is hardly a stereotype central banker.
      He is also a keen sportsman who likes to watch football and
  play golf.
      Poehl says currency market intervention cannot substitute
  for correct economic policies if exchange rates are imbalanced.
      ""But you can achieve an enormous effect with a small amount
  if you strike at the right moment,"" he said. Bundesbank dealers
  are very professional and skilled. ""They've burnt the fingers of
  many people,"" he said. And unlike the speculators, Poehl notes,
  the Bundesbank dealers usually make a profit.

  Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)
  has drawn up a detailed plan calling for large tax cuts and an
  increase in government purchases of foreign goods, the head of
  the committee working out the plan, Junichiro Koizumi, said.
      The plan will also urge the government to double 1985's
  official development assistance to 7.6 billion dlrs within five
  years instead of seven as the government had promised, senior
  LDP officials said at a press conference.
      LDP executive council chairman Shintaro Abe will explain
  the plan to U.S. Officials when he visits the U.S. On April 19.
      Abe's visit is to prepare for Prime Minister Yasuhiro
  Nakasone's talks with President Ronald Reagan later this month.
      Koizumi said the LDP plan will not specify the size of the
  tax cut or the amount of domestic demand to be stimulated.
  However, top LDP executives will work out figures so that Abe
  will be able to offer specifics to U.S. Officials.
      The proposed increase in procurement of foreign goods by
  the government will probably include the purchase of super
  computers, LDP officials said.
  
  specific trade problems with other nations and will encourage
  flows of funds to developing countries, the officials said.
      The LDP expects the measures to prop up the economy and
  lessen trade problems with the U.S., They added.
      The basic ideas of the LDP's plan were presented to and
  welcomed by monetary authorities of the major industrial
  nations in Washington last week, they said.
      The LDP plan will form the basis for the last of several
  packages to stimulate Japanese domestic demand and will be
  unveiled by the government in late May.

test/21368,"SOVIETS OUTLINE 1988 ECONOMIC TARGETS
  The Soviet Union outlined its economic
  targets for 1988 on Monday, stressing the need to improve
  standards in the country's sluggish engineering industry.
      Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin told the Supreme Soviet
  industrial output should rise by 4.5 pct in 1988, up from a
  planned 4.4 pct in 1987. It rose 3.6 pct in Jan-Sept 1987.
      Talyzin said national income, the nearest Soviet equivalent
  to gross national product, should rise by 4.3 pct against a
  planned 4.1 pct this year. Gross national product measures the
  output of a country's goods and services.
      He said the Kremlin planned to produce 235 mln tonnes of
  grain in 1988 versus a planned 232 mln this year. Moscow
  produced 210 mln tonnes in 1986.
      Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has described
  machine-builing as a sector whose rapid modernization is
  essential if the Soviet Union is to compete effectively on
  world markets.
      ""Certain difficulties have arisen this year in the
  machine-building industry. The economy is not receiving a
  considerable amount of the equipment that it requires,"" said
  Talyzin, who heads the state planning committee GOSPLAN.
      Soviet data show the machine-building industry, which makes
  machine tools, instruments and other engineering goods,
  increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of 1987
  compared with the same period last year.
      However, this was far below the 7.3 pct increase planned
  for the industry for the whole of 1988.
      Talyzin said the ruling Politburo had concluded at a recent
  meeting that an improvement in economic performance depended to
  a large extent on conserving resources better. ""Large-scale
  measures are planned to save resources,"" he said.
      Finance Minister Boris Gostev told the Supreme Soviet that
  defense spending in 1988 would total 32 billion dlrs, the same
  figure as was announced last year.
      Western governments view official Soviet estimates for
  defense spending as highly understated, but say the real figure
  is hard to calculate because Soviet military industries are
  intertwined with the civilian economy.
      Talyzin said the Kremlin also decided to increase spending
  next year on medical services, education, pensions and social
  insurance schemes.

  A Colombian group announced the suspension

  dlrs fine on the Occidental Petroleum Corp &lt;OXY>.
      There was no indication the government would meet the
  conditions demanded by the leftist National Liberation Army
  (ELN).
      According to the state oil firm, ECOPETROL, the ELN carried
  out 72 attacks on petroleum pipelines between 1984 and 1986.
      The assaults, the most recent launched two months ago, have
  caused an estimated total of 50 mln dlrs in damage.
      In a communique, the ELN said it would demand a tax of one
  dollar per barrel of crude oil pumped by foreign firms as a
  condition for maintaining its suspension of the assaults.
      Foreign oil firms pump an average of 225,083 barrels per
  day in Colombia. Colombian tax authorities are investigating
  Occidental, a U.S.-owned firm, for alleged tax evasion.
      If the charges are proven, the firm could face a fine of up
  to 800 mln dlrs. The ELN demands the government charge the
  penalty.

test/14843,"SUMITOMO BANK AIMS AT QUICK RECOVERY FROM MERGER
  Sumitomo Bank Ltd &lt;SUMI.T> is certain to
  lose its status as Japan's most profitable bank as a result of
  its merger with the Heiwa Sogo Bank, financial analysts said.
      Osaka-based Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9
  trillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bank
  with an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, in
  October.
      But despite the link-up, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsu
  told Reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain its
  position.
      ""We'll be back in position in first place within three
  years,"" Komatsu said in an interview.
      He said that while the merger will initially reduce
  Sumitomo's profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expand
  Sumitomo's branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area where
  it has been relatively weak.
      But financial analysts are divided on whether and how
  quickly the gamble will pay off.
      Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo in
  view of the smaller bank's large debts. Others argue the merger
  was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch
  network from scratch.
      The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has
  expanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business
  and geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the
  wisdom of some of those moves.
      ""They've made bold moves to put everything in place. Now
  it's largely out of their hands,"" said Kleinwort Benson Ltd
  financial analyst Simon Smithson.
      Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move to
  enter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American
  investment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.
      Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5
  pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at
  least, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange
  personnel, or increase the business they do with each other.
      ""The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the
  Fed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,"" said one analyst.
      But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.
      ""U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so,
  we can do various things. We only have to wait two or three
  years, not until the 21st century,"" Komatsu said.
      Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes
  into the securities business at home.
      Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan's
  version of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial
  from investment banking.
      But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu
  said he hopes further deregulation will create new
  opportunities.
      ""We need to find new business chances,"" Komatsu said. ""In some
  cases these will be securities related, in some cases trust
  bank related. That's the kind of deregulation we want.""
      Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such
  domestic securities business as profitable government bond
  dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co
  Ltd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.
      He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering
  the securities business here through its Swiss universal bank
  subsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.
       The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to
  securities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,
  following a similar decision for subsidiaries of European
  universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.
      But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar
  decision on a Gottardo subsidiary.
      ""We don't want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed
  in two or three years,"" he said.
      Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand
  lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to
  replace disappearing demand from big business, he added.
      The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of
  time to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the
  merger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.
      ""It's (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies,"" said
  Kleinwort's Smithson.
      ""After that, it's a question of absorbing and juggling
  around. It will be the next decade before we see if the
  strategy is right or wrong.""

test/15212,"J.P. MORGAN&lt;JPM> SAYS DLR MAY PREVENT FED EASING
  The relatively high level of real U.S.
  interest rates suggests that there is scope for further
  declines in money market rates, but the Federal Reserve is
  unlikely to promote such a drop as long as the dollar remains
  volatile, said J.P. Morgan and Co Inc chairman Lewis Preston.
      He said in response to a reporter's question after the
  bank's annual meeting that money market rates could decline
  further but, ""I don't think the Fed is going to encourage that
  as long as the exchange markets are as volatile as they are.""
      On the other hand, he said that, barring a collapse of the
  dollar, he did not see rates going much higher.
      He said that Morgan's recent rise in its prime lending rate
  was ""purely a reflection of an increase in a whole spectrum of
  rates.""
      Preston reiterated earlier company forecasts that the U.S.
  economy should show roughly 2.5 to three pct real growth this
  year.
      He also said that as a consequence of the dollar's decline
  and oil price rises, inflation would rise ""moderately"" to a 3.5
  to four pct rate in 1987.

test/17812,"USPCI &lt;UPC> SEEN REJECTING UNION PACIFIC BID
  share bid made last Wednesday by Union Pacific Corp (UNP), 
  analysts said.
      ""The offer is inadequate,"" said Douglas Augenthaler, an
  analyst with E.F. Hutton, noting that it does not represent the
  needed premium over the company's fundamental value based on
  earnings estimates.
      USPCI, which has 8.7 mln shares outstanding, was trading at
  48-1/8, down 3/8.
      USPCI vice president of finance Larry Shelton said he could
  not comment on the adequacy of the offer or on when the board
  would meet to consider it.
      Augenthaler said that while USPCI was trading at only 34
  dlrs a share at the time of the takeover bid, its announcement
  that same day of higher earnings expectations changed its
  value. USPCI said its second quarter earnings would exceed
  analysts expectations of 24 to 30 cts a share.
      At that price, USPCI could maintain a stock price in the
  low 40s, Augenthaler said.
      Hutton revised its 1987 earnings estimate for the waste
  management concern to 1.40 dlrs a share from 1.20 dlrs on the
  announcment, he said. It lifted its 1988 projection to 1.90
  dlrs a share from 1.70 dlrs.
      In addition, analysts said the hazardous waste management
  business holds significant growth potential. The industry has
  grown from 16 to 35 pct over the last five years, based on
  earnings per share, said Jeffrey Klein, an analyst with Kidder
  Peabody and Co. The industry is expected to continue growing at
  15 to 35 pct over the next five years, he said.
      Augenthaler said the 43-dlr-a-share offer, or 375 mln dlrs
  total, would be a bargain for Union Pacific. The transportation
  and energy company would both gain entry into a profitable
  business and win cost-control benefits, he said.
      ""Union Pacific has what are rumored to be some fairly
  signficant environmmental problems of its own,"" he said.
      Herb Mee Jr., president of Beard Oil Co (BEC), which holds
  a 30.4 pct stake in USPCI, said last week Union Pacific's offer
  was ""grossly inadequate.""

  The European Community (EC) should
  watch very carefully for any developments in the Gulf War and
  their consequences on the oil market, EC Energy Commissioner
  Nicolas Mosar said today.
      Speaking two weeks after a U.S. warship was attacked in the
  Gulf, Mosar warned, ""An escalation in the Gulf would increase
  tensions in the oil market.""
      ""But I do not want to be alarmist,"" he told a news conference
  after an EC energy ministers meeting in Luxembourg.
      He said the volume of EC oil imports from the Gulf had
  declined to around 31 pct of total oil imports in the first
  three months of 1987 against 35 pct in the same period last
  year. ""There are also other potential sources of supplies in the
  world,"" he added.
      The issue of Gulf oil imports was not discussed at the
  ministers' meeting, he added.
      A EC committee of national experts in the so-called oil
  supply group would discuss Gulf oil supplies at their bi-annual
  meeting on June 19, he said.
      But any major decisions would have to be reserved for EC
  foreign ministers, diplomats said.
      West European nations have so far shown little enthusiasm
  for backing a U.S. plan to give military protection to merchant
  ships in the Gulf which could help insure the safety of oil
  supplies.

  The United States responded to an
  apparent escalation of Iranian rhetoric with continued
  assurances that its expanded military force in the Gulf would
  play purely a deterrent role.
      ""I can only emphasize that our role there is deterrent, that
  we're going to be assuring safety for American shipping and
  that that shipping is not related to the war itself,"" State
  Department spokesman Charles Redman told reporters.
      He was asked about Iranian claims that the United States
  was moving towards the brink of armed conflict with Iran.
      Tehran Radio quoted defence spokesman Ali Akbar Hashemi
  Rafsanjani telling a visiting Nicaraguan delegation yesterday,
  ""At the moment the United States is moving towards the brink of
  an armed encounter with us.
      ""We are not concerned about this and believe that the U.S.
  Presence in the war will make our nation even more serious. We
  are determined to stand firm and will certainly win.""
      The United States disclosed last week it was beefing up its
  Gulf fleet from seven to 10 warships and also sending the
  refurbished battleship Missouri to patrol just outside the
  strategic Strait of Hormuz, entrance to the Gulf.
      The buildup ties in with U.S. Plans to escort Kuwaiti oil
  tankers which have been re-registered to fly the American flag
  and gain naval protection against Iranian attacks.
      Asked about the Iranian rhetoric, White House spokesman
  Marlin Fitzwater said, ""We won't have any comment or response to
  the Iranian statements. Our position has been made clear about
  the status of events in the Gulf. We want an end to the war
  with no winners and no losers and any activities or statements
  that tend to prolong the war or increase hostilities are not
  helpful or welcome.""
      Redman said he could not independently confirm reports that
  Iran has offered to halt attacks on Gulf shipping.

test/19241,"HARCOURT &lt;HBJ> MUM ON REED &lt;REED.L> RUMORS
  Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc officials
  were not available for comment on market rumors that it is
  interested in acquiring Reed International plc &lt;REED.L>.
      Officials of First Boston Inc, Harcourt's financial
  adviser, declined comment.
      A Wall Street arbitrageur, who owns Harcourt shares, said
  the rumors did not make much sense because Harcourt has
  announced a recapitalization plan to ward off a takeover
  attempt by British publisher Robert Maxwell.""It's completely
  inconsistent with the recapitalization, the only way is if they
  drop the recapitalization,"" he said.
      Calls to Harcourt seeking comment were not returned.
      Harcourt's recapitalization will come under scrutiny of a
  U.S. Court in Orlando, Fla. Monday. The company has sought a
  declaratory judgment on convertibility of debentures due 2011
  in light of the recapitalization.
      Harcourt said in a statement this week that Salomon
  Brothers Inc &lt;SB> and Mutual Shares Corp have intervened in the
  case, claiming ownership of more than 30 mln dlrs face amount
  of the debenture. In addition, British Printing and
  Communications Corp, headed by Maxwell, owns 9.5 mln dlrs face
  amount, Harcourt said.
      Salomon said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
  Commission today that it has 21,978 of the debentures. If the
  court decides they should be converted at par value of one dlr,
  they could be converted into 22.0 mln shares.
      Harcourt is asking the court to rule the company is not
  required to issue common to debenture holders who did not
  convert prior to June eight.
      An increase in Reed shares in London today was attributed
  by brokers to rumors of Harcourt's interest and also to rumors
  that Maxwell might be a buyer. But an adviser to Maxwell in New
  York said ""there's no basis to think that it's us.""

test/19559,"KUWAIT SEES OPEC OUTPUT OVER CEILING TO END-YEAR
  OPEC output for the second half of 1987,
  including that of Iraq, will be above the official 16.6 mln
  barrels per day (bpd) output ceiling agreed by OPEC Saturday,
  Kuwait oil minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said.
      Iraq refused to sign the pact, by which OPEC maintained its
  ceiling at 16.6 mln bpd for both the third and fourth quarters
  of 1987. In December, OPEC set a provisional fourth quarter
  level of 18.3 mln bpd, now cut back to the third quarter
  target.
      Ali told a news conference that including Iraq, ""OPEC third
  quarter output will be between 17.5 and 17.7 mln bpd while
  fourth quarter output will be nearly 18 mln bpd""
      Ali did not detail what effect he thought these production
  levels would have on prices.
      Iraq has an official first half quota of 1.466 mln bpd,
  rising to 1.54 mln in the second half, but has refused to
  adhere to it and has recently been producing around two mln
  barrels per day, exporting it through pipelines to Saudi Arabia
  and Turkey. Iraq's export capacity will be further boosted when
  a 500,000 bpd oil pipeline via Turkey comes on stream in about
  September.
      Iraq has been insisting on a quota equal to its Gulf War
  enemy Iran, which has a quota of 2.255 mln bpd, rising to 2.369
  mln in the second half.
      Ali said the position of the 400,000 bpd production from
  the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which has
  been supplied to Iraq as war relief crude, was fixed. ""We will
  not discuss it. There will not be any change,"" he said.
      Ali said the conference, which began Thursday and ended
  Saturday evening, had been too short for all necessary problems
  to be adressed. ""We are overdoing it in holding too short a
  meeting. We sweep a lot under the carpet,"" he said.
      Ali said the problem of price differentials between the
  prices of various OPEC crudes had not been dealt with properly
  at the meeting.
  
      Ali said ""The problem of differentials is a real one. I
  would hate to be producing today a light crude and that problem
  has not been dealt with properly. Light crudes are overpriced
  relative to heavy crudes.""
      Asked if the issue of differentials would be raised at the
  next OPEC meeting to be held in Vienna on December 9, Ali said
  ""If my crudes are affected I will raise the issue, I will not do
  the work of another minister.""
      Kuwait's own crudes range from medium to heavy grades.
      OPEC reintroduced fixed prices on February 1, with a spread
  of 2.65 dlrs a barrel between its lightest and heaviest crudes.

test/16513,"GAF &lt;GAF> SEEN RAISING BORG-WARNER &lt;BOR> BID
  GAF Corp, set on acquiring Borg-Warner
  Corp's valuable plastics business, is believed by analysts to
  be preparing an increased offer for the Chicago-based company.
       Yesterday, Borg-Warner said it agreed to be acquired for
  4.23 billion dlrs by a company to be formed by Merrill Lynch
  Capital Partners. Merrill offered 48.50 dlrs cash per share for
  89 pct of Borg-Warner's common stock, and a package of cash and
  securities for the balance.
      Borg-Warner stock rose 1-3/8 to 49-5/8.
      ""I think it's (the stock price) telling us GAF is coming in
  with another bid,"" said one analyst, who values the company at
  51 or 52 dlrs per share.
      GAF has offered 46 dlrs per share. It holds 19.9 pct of
  Borg-Warner's stock.
      ""You're in a cat and mouse game on how you're going to up
  the price. Obviously, nobody wants to pay more than you have
  to. I think GAF is looking at the company the way we're looking
  at it - that it's worth more,"" Pershing and Co analyst Richard
  Henderson said.
      Henderson estimated it is worth abouth 55 dlrs per share.
      GAF has only said it was reviewing the situation. Merrill
  Lynch officials did not return phone calls.
      Analysts have said they believe GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman
  sought Borg-Warner because of its chemicals and plastics
  business. The rigid plastics are used in such things as
  telephones, computer terminals, and appliances.
      ""Where the heck can you buy a world class chemical
  operation these days,"" said Henderson.
      ""He's (Heyman's) got the bucks. He's a heavy hitter, and he
  does not like to get pushed around,"" said Henderson.
      GAF, a roofing and chemicals concern, attempted a takeover
  of the much larger Union Carbide Corp two years ago. While GAF
  did not win the company, it made a substantial gain on its
  investment in Carbide.
      Analysts said GAF already has a large profit built into its
  Borg-Warner holdings. They said even if GAF raises its offer
  and does not succeed, a higher bid from another company would
  give GAF millions of dollars in profits on its stock.
      ""It's a win-win situation,"" said one analyst.
      One analyst speculated an offer from GAF would be
  forthcoming shortly.
      ""I think we are finally down to the final paragraph in this
  book,"" he said.
      Borg-Warner's other businesses include automotive parts,
  protective services, which includes Wells Fargo security
  guards, and Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.
      Charles Rose, an Oppenheimer and Co analyst who follows
  GAF, said if GAF were to sell into the Merrill Lynch offer, it
  would realize about 125 mln dlrs net profit, or about 3.50 per
  share.
      ""I think there's a probability he goes up in price,"" said
  Rose.
      Rose said, however, he could not really predict what Heyman
  would do. ""Sam's a low-risk, high-return player.""
      ""Is he trying to build a major industrial chemical
  enterprise, or is he trying to be an investment bank,"" Rose
  said.
      Analysts said Borg-Warner's chemical business would add
  earnings momentum to GAF. ""I worked out that paying as much as
  50 dlrs per share would still be additive to GAF in time, if
  they sold off most of the non-chemical facilities,"" said John
  Henry of E.F. Hutton.
      Borg-Warner's chemical and plastics business provided 1986
  operating profits of 153.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.04 billion
  dlrs. Total operating profits were 349.7 mln dlrs, and net
  earnings were 206.3 mln dlrs for 1986.
      ""The Borg chemical business is great,"" said Rose, adding
  its only U.S. competitors are Monsanto Co &lt;MCT> and Dow
  Chemical Co &lt;DOW>.

test/19285,"U.S. OIL PRICES STRONG AHEAD OF OPEC MEETING
  U.S. crude oil prices are at their
  highest level in more than a year ahead of next week's OPEC
  meeting, even though most industry analysts do not expect any
  policy changes from the session.
      They said prices, which have steadily climbed since the
  organization's accord in December, have risen on technical
  factors within the market and concerns about supplies because
  of the Iran-Iraq war, which could disrupt deliveries from the
  Gulf.
      The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate is trading
  around 20.55 dlrs in the July contract on New York Mercantile
  Exchange's energy futures and in the spot market. That is its
  highest level since January 1986.
      OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman, who is Nigeria's
  oil minister, said Friday he expects the meeting in Vienna to
  be brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production
  agreement may only need a slight review.
      Although most industry experts expect just a reaffirmation
  of the December agreement, oil prices continue to climb due to
  a desire to hedge positions in case of any surprises.
      Analysts expect the higher prices to continue until soon
  after the OPEC meeting. At that point, barring any increased
  tension in the Gulf or changes in OPEC's policies, prices
  should begin easing.
      ""OPEC will probably not do anything it hasn't already agreed
  to in December because oil prices are firm,"" said John Hill, a
  vice president at Merrill Lynch Futures.
      OPEC agreed in December to maintain official oil prices at
  18 dlrs a barrel and raise the group's production ceiling to
  16.6 mln barrels per day in the third quarter and to 18.3 mln
  barrels in the fourth quarter.
      This agreement helped send prices sharply higher, rising
  from 15 dlrs a barrel in early December.
      Several OPEC members who are price hawks, including Iran,
  Algeria and Libya, will seek a higher official price and a
  reduction in output.
      ""And if U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude continues to
  trade above 20 dlrs a barrel, there is a greater chance that
  OPEC will raise its official 18 dlrs price,"" said Nauman
  Barakat, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.
      But most analysts expect the more moderate producers, such
  as Saudi Arabia, to block any changes in policy.
      ""The meeting will be a non-event with no change in the
  official prices because OPEC, and in particular the Saudis, are
  committed to stabilizing the market,"" said Rosario Ilacqua,
  analyst with L.F. Rothschild.
      However, some analysts said OPEC may need to hold a meeting
  in September to re-evaluate market conditions.
      Overproduction by OPEC will become a real problem in the
  fourth quarter when the quota is raised to 18.3 mln barrels a
  day and Iraq's pipeline through Turkey brings another 500,000
  barrels to the market each day, said John Lichtblau, president
  of Petroleum Industry Ressearch Foundation.
      Most expect Saudi Arabia to oppose a price increase at this
  meeting but many look for an increase by year-end to 20 dlrs to
  offset the decline in the dollar. Oil prices are denominated
  throughout the world in dollars, so as the currency declines,
  producers receive less money for their oil.
      ""The only real production restraint in OPEC is Saudi Arabia,""
  said Sanford Margoshes, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers.
      ""In the second half of the year we expect the Saudis not to
  produce at their 4.1 mln barrel a day quota and therefore act
  as a vehicle to stablize the market and pave the way for a two
  dlrs a barrel price increase at the December 1987 meeting,"" he
  said.
      One uncertain factor is the course of the Iran-Iraq war.
      ""The wild card is the increased tensions in the Persian
  Gulf,"" said Frank Knuettel, analyst with Prudential-Bache
  Securites.
      Oil tankers taking oil from Iraq and Kuwait have been
  regular targets for Iranian planes. The Reagan administration
  is planning to put Kuwait tankers under the protection of the
  U.S. flag, with naval escorts.
      ""Extra (oil) inventories are needed during a time of crisis
  like this, and just general nervousness over an incident that
  could disrupt oil supplies drives prices up,"" Knuettel said.

  The White House has completed a new
  review of Japanese semiconductor trading practices but has not
  yet decided whether trade sanctions levied against Japan last
  April should be lifted, U.S. officials said.
      They said the president's Economic Policy Council looked at
  Japan's adherence to the 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact
  yesterday and that an announcement may be made shortly.
      But there was no hint what the announcement might be.
      Officials have said the 100 pct tariffs on 300 mln dlrs of
  Japanese exports could be modified if Japan was found to be
  honoring a portion of its semiconductor pact.
      But they also noted that the White House has said it was
  unlikely the tariffs would be lifted before the meeting of the
  world's seven major economic powers in Venice on June 8-10.
      The officials added that while the curbs complicated
  U.S.-Japanese economic cooperation, they did serve to blunt 
  Congressional criticism that the Reagan Administrtation was not
  taking tough actions to reduce he U.S. trade deficit.
      Reagan imposed the sanctions on April 17 in retaliation for
  Japan's failure to honor commitments to end dumping
  semiconductors in world markets at less than production costs
  and to open its own market to U.S. goods.
      The sanctions were levied on certain Japanese television
  sets, personal computers and hand-held power tools.
      Reagan, in imposing the curbs, said they would be lifted as
  soon as there was evidence of a pattern that Japan was adhering
  to the pact.

  Fiji today welcomed the ending of a trade
  ban imposed by Australian labor unions as supporters of the
  country's ousted prime minister Timoci Bavadra renewed pressure
  for his reinstatement with strikes and shop closures.
      The government welcomed a decision by the Australian
  Waterside Workers' Federation to lift its ban on shipments to
  Fiji, imposed in support of Bavadra, whose newly-elected
  government was overthrown in a military coup on May 14.
      The ban had threatened food shortages of imported wheat,
  fresh vegetables and medicines. A direct result of the union
  decision would be the immediate shipment of 9,000 tons of rice
  and wheat from an Australian port, the government said.
      Shops in Nadi and Lautoka, center of the country's sugar
  industry, closed again today in support of Bavadra.
      In Nadi two bomb threats forced evacuation of the
  Australian Westpac bank, but police said they turned out to be
  a hoax. Bavadra has launched a campaign of civil disobedience
  to press for his reinstatement.

test/16144,"AWB CHAIRMAN URGES FARMERS NOT TO CUT PLANTINGS
  Australia could lose valuable wheat
  markets through lack of availability if plantings for the
  coming 1987/88 season are significantly reduced, Australian
  Wheat Board (AWB) chairman Clinton Condon said.
      ""If predictions of a 30 pct decrease in plantings prove
  true, Australia may not be able to supply wheat to some of its
  valuable markets,"" he said in a statement.
      Condon did not say who had made the predictions, but an AWB
  spokesman said there was a general industry feeling that
  farmers, hard hit by low prices and rising costs, could cut
  back plantings sharply. Wheat sowing normally begins in May.
      However, Condon said he did not believe plantings would be
  cut by as much as 30 pct although he realised many farmers were
  facing enormous financial pressures.
      He said the AWB expects the area sown to be about 10.7 mln
  hectares, down from 11.3 mln in 1986/87 when the crop was about
  16 mln tonnes. Final crop estimates for 1986/87 and planting
  intentions for 1987/88 are not yet available.
      If the AWB is unable, because of a short-term cut in
  plantings, to meet the needs of the markets it has developed
  with much time and effort, it may have great difficulty selling
  wheat to those markets in the future, Condon said.
      ""Markets which rely on a steady supply of Australian wheat
  understand a decrease in production due to drought but they
  will have difficulty understanding a deliberate decision to
  decrease production,"" Condon said.
      ""If Australia wants wheat to continue as a major export
  income earner, governments and government authorities will need
  to closely examine ways of contributing to the continuing
  viability of the wheat industry,"" he added.
      Australia's leading wheat markets include China, Egypt,
  Iran, Iraq, the Soviet Union and Japan.

  U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
  Yeutter said it was all but certain President Reagan would go
  ahead today and impose curbs on Japanese exports as planned.
      Asked in a television interview what the chance was for
  Reagan to cancel the scheduled 100 pct tariffs on Japanese
  electronic exports, he said ""slim to none.""
      Reagan announced on March 27 he would impose the tariffs to
  retaliate for Japan's failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end
  dumping computer semiconductors in world markets at less than
  cost and to open its home markets to U.S. products.
      Yeutter, on the NBC program ""Today,"" said the United States
  did not want to terminate the agreement and would drop
  the tariffs once Japan began fulfilling the agreement.
      He said Japanese negotiators last week told U.S. officials
  they were honoring the pact, but Yeutter said it would take
  time to monitor any compliance.
      Asked how long that would take, he said ""We want to see a
  pattern of compliance, so in a minimum I would say that would
  take a few weeks.""
      Yeutter said he did not think there would be much consumer
  impact by the tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods
  because the items selected are also readily available from
  other countries and manufacturers.
      He said he did not think Japan would retaliate.
      ""It seems to me it is not in the interests of either country
  to get in an escalating conflict.  The Japanese understand that
  full well,"" Yeutter said.
      He added Japan might challenge the tariffs in the General
  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), but ""that's more of a
  paper kind of exercise and I don't really expect to see any
  adverse impact on U.S. trade.""
      Yeutter also said he did not see any way the semiconductor

test/20101,"IRAN PLANS TO FILE LAWSUITS OVER U.S. RAID
  Iran is preparing lawsuits to file for
  compensation from the U.S. Over the American raid on its Gulf
  oil platforms, Tehran radio quoted Iranian Oil Minister
  Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying.
      The lawsuits would be filed with competent international
  bodies once the exact damage was calculated, he was quoted
  telling a news conference in Tehran. He earlier estimated the
  damage from the U.S. Raid at about 500 mln dlrs.
      The rigs, one of which was heavily shelled by four American
  destroyers on Monday, were still burning almost 24 hours after
  the attack, he said.
      Aqazadeh said the half-billion-dollar damage estimate was
  preliminary. Washington has said the attack was in response to
  a missile strike against the American-flag tanker the Sea Isle
  City in Kuwaiti waters on Friday.
      He denied that there was any military hardware on the rigs
  ""except a 23 mm machinegun for air defence."" Reacting to
  Weinberger's remark that Washington considered the case closed,
  Aqazadeh said: ""Iran will also consider the case closed after
  its retaliatory measure."" Iranian officials have said their
  response would not be limited to the Gulf and U.S. Interests
  around the world might come under attack.
      Aqazadeh said the U.S. Military presence in the Gulf
  aggravated the regional crisis and made access to the region's
  oil more difficult, but he did not see the U.S. Attack
  significantly affecting oil prices.
      IRNA said he gave no explicit reply when asked if the
  attack would prompt Iran to block the Hormuz Strait at the
  entrance to the Gulf.
      ""If Iran cannot use the Hormuz Strait, no other country can
  either, and this would be to everyone's harm,"" the radio quoted
  him as saying.

test/15313,"CANADA TO MONITOR STEEL IMPORTS, EXPORTS
  Canada plans to monitor steel shipments
  flowing in and out of the country in an attempt to appease
  concerns in the U.S. over the high level of Canadian steel
  exports, Trade Minister Pat Carney said.
      ""To help maintain our open access to the U.S. steel market,
  the government is taking further action to ensure we have more
  accurate data on exports and imports and that Canada is not
  used as a backdoor to the U.S. market by offshore suppliers,""
  Carney said.
      Carney also said Canadian companies were being asked to
  exercise prudence in the U.S. market and both countries were
  considering establishing a joint commission to study the
  growing steel problem.
      Carney told the House of Commons she will soon announce an
  amendment to the Exports and Imports Permits Act to set up the
  monitoring program.
      Canadian steel shipments to the U.S. have risen to 5.7 pct
  cent of the U.S. market in recent months, almost double the
  level just two years ago, Canadian trade officials said.
      The increase in Canadian shipments comes at a time of
  growing anger in the U.S. over rising steel imports from
  several countries in the face of a decline in the domestic
  steel industry.
      Some U.S. lawmakers have proposed Canada's share of the
  American market be limited to 2.4 pct.

test/15194,"HEINEKEN SEES HIGHER PROFITS, WIDER PENETRATION
  Dutch brewer Heineken NV said it hoped
  to maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth to
  the 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986, despite
  continuing investments in a reorganization program and efforts
  to extend world penetration.
      Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mln
  guilders, after 265 mln in 1985.
      Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company, Europe's
  leading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986,
  said sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters.
      The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S.,
  Where the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand, and in Europe,
  where sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total.
      Turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weaker
  foreign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders.
      Further consolidation of foreign companies, including the
  increase of its stake in leading Spanish brewery &lt;El Aguila
  S.A.> to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularly
  in French and Spanish interests, eroded profit margins. The
  company still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in
  restructuring and marketing, Heineken said.
      Heineken's Spanish activities should start yielding profit
  next year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had
  already turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.
      Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the
  European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer
  into the closed West German market -- Europe's biggest beer
  market -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. ""We
  have the beer, but distribution and sales is the important
  point,"" van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken
  had been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.
      ""The question is not if we want to penetrate the German
  market, but how we are to do it,"" van Schaik said, adding that
  while the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a
  taste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very
  regionalized.
       Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for
  African operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most
  important beer growth markets in the long term.
       He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with
  majority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was
  hampered by the lack of hard currencies there.
      Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters
  per head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions
  and currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total
  1986 sales.
      On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price
  of imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists
  have been looking at other possibilities.
      To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on
  the Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which
  had sold successfully, Coebergh said.
      Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw
  materials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were
  popular in Rwanda . ""This is a possibility, but we could not
  possibly achieve the Heineken flavor,"" Coebergh said.
      Chairman Heineken said the company's seven year efforts to
  penetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a
  contract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.
      But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken's
  market potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow that
  are enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept western
  money.

test/17452,"U.S. STUDY SAYS TARIFFS AND QUOTAS COULD BACKFIRE
  The use of tariffs and quotas to
  reduce the flow of foreign goods into the United States will do
  little to cut the nation's swelling trade deficit, a government
  study said.
      In fact, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report said,
  such protectionist policies could make U.S. Products less
  competitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost of
  imported products that are re-exported in different forms.
      ""Such policies are much more likely to hurt, rather than
  help, the productive capabilities of the U.S. Economy,"" it said.
      The 218-page report, written by FTC economists John Hilke
  and Philip Nelson, blamed the rising trade shortfall, which
  climbed to a record 166.3 billion dlrs last year, on shifting
  currency exchange rates and growing U.S consumer demand.
      Other factors commonly blamed for the deficit, such as
  foreign trade practices, deteriorating U.S. Industrial
  competitiveness, high labour costs and government restrictions
  on mergers, added little to the problem, it said.
      ""Although each industry's competitiveness affects the level
  of imports and exports in that industry, in general we find
  that there have been no significant industry-specific changes
  affecting competitiveness that would explain the increase in
  the overall trade deficit,"" the study said.
      ""To the extent any government action is needed to deal with
  the trade deficits, policies should focus on economy-wide
  phenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth,""
  the FTC study said.
      Supporting its conclusion that broad-based economic shifts
  were the cause of the increase in the trade deficit, the report
  said it found that nearly all U.S. Industries lost some
  domestic market share to foreign competitors in the 1980s.
      It also said it found a ""fairly direct relationship"" between
  the increased trade deficit and the influence of shifting
  currency exchange rates, U.S. Economic growth and domestic
  demand for goods and services, which has outpaced foreign
  consumer demand.
      The study examined seven factors which have been commonly
  blamed for the trade deficit: foreign government subsidies and
  trade barriers to protect foreign industries, a lack of
  investment in U.S. Industry, declining research and development
  in U.S. Industry, high labour costs, union work rules, the oil
  prices rises of the 1970s and U.S. Antitrust regulations.
      In each case, the study found little or no evidence that
  the factor had any impact on the trade deficit.

      The company said that in the event of certain triggering

  Karl Otto Poehl, head of West Germany's
  central bank, and Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg are
  normally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt the
  central bank's independence.
      But a rare public row between the ebullient Poehl,
  president of the Bundesbank, and Stoltenberg, over a
  controversial investment tax proposal, has added to the woes of
  the country's already nervous financial markets, bankers said.
      Poehl told an investment symposium in Frankfurt last
  Thursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs and
  interest rates
      Stoltenberg quickly issued a statement rebutting Poehl's
  criticism, saying West Germany would remain an attractive place
  for foreign investors.
      ""The obvious lack of coordination between the Bundesbank and
  Finance Ministry does not instil confidence in foreign
  investors,"" said one economist for a London broker, who asked
  not to be identified.
      Bankers here expressed confidence the two top financial
  policy-makers would quickly patch up their relationship to
  steer the economy through a particularly difficult time.
      ""There are plenty of objective pressures which will result
  in things getting back to normal again after a period of ill
  feeling,"" said Commerzbank AG chief economist Juergen Pfister.
      News on October 9 that the government was planning a 10 pct
  withholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds in
  a market already reeling from rising interest rates at home and
  abroad.
      Bankers said the Bundesbank was angered by the way the
  finance ministry announced the plan -- without consulting the
  Bundesbank adequately, and allowing apparently conflicting
  details to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market.
      Both Poehl, 57, and Stoltenberg, 59, have been under
  extraordinary pressures lately.
      Poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by his
  deputy, Helmut Schlesinger, jacking up interest rates to fight
  inflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he had
  pursued so far this year to promote currency stability.
      In recent statements Poehl has sounded more like
  Schlesinger. For years the softly-spoken economist has been
  warning in speech after speech that excessive money supply
  growth would eventually lead to rising prices.
      Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbank
  council, and since late summer Poehl has had to represent his
  views, bankers said.
      ""Poehl is in a minority in his own house,"" said Commerzbank's
  Pfister.
      ""Poehl is in a dilemma. He must follow a policy that is not
  entirely his own,"" said another economist.
      The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far,
  they will attract funds into the country, pushing up the mark
  and hurting West German exporters.
      The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the
  Bundesbank's new tack became clear in early October.
      Since last Thursday, United States Treasury Secretary James
  Baker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases.
      Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986
  war of words between the U.S. And West Germany, in which U.S.
  Officials talked down the dollar to force West Germany to
  stimulate its economy and thus suck in more U.S. Exports.
      One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a round
  of tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990.
      But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for
  Stoltenberg than he had bargained for.
      The cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly voted
  most popular government politician last year, had to face
  resistance from local barons in the government coalition
  parties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts.
      The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising
  4.3 billion marks.
      But it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it will
  push up borrowing costs. The extra amount this costs the
  government could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in.
      Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row
  which has turned into the country's worst political scandal.
      Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington last
  month early to sort out a row in the northern state of
  Schleswig-Holstein, where he heads the ruling CDU party.
      The state's CDU premier, Uwe Barschel, had to resign after
  allegations of a ""dirty tricks"" election campaign led to heavy
  losses for the CDU in state elections.
      Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva last
  weekend. Police say the death appears to have been suicide.
      Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the more
  remarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats, and
  was appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
      When Poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier this
  year, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led coalition government
  gave Poehl another eight-year term.
      Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said he
  hoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again.
      But when Poehl criticized Stoltenberg's tax plans he was
  not only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the
  Bundesbank's independence of government, Chrobok said.

  A group of Latin American and
  Caribbean nations formally opposed trade legislation pending in
  Congress, saying it would curb their exports, slow development
  and hinder its ability to repay foreign debt.
      Mario Rodriguez Montero, president of an Organization of
  American States special committee on trade, said he was aware
  of the large U.S. trade deficit, but added ""the region should
  not be the one affected by the trade bills.""
      He said the causes of the deficit were the strong dollar
  and the budget deficit, and ""it is regrettable to solve it by a
  trade bill that would only serve private U.S. interests.""
      Rodriguez made the comment at a news conference after two
  days of meetings with U.S. officials on trade bills now in
  Congress that are designed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit,
  which last year hit a record 166.3 billion dlrs.
      Congressional observers say the bills are aimed mainly at
  Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and a few other nations with large,
  annual trade surpluses with the United States.
      Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela are the only Latin nations
  with large trade surpluses last year with the United States,
  but even Mexico, with the largest, had a surplus of only 5.2
  billion dlrs, against Japan's of 58.6 billion dlrs.
      The European Community has also opposed the bills.
      Rodriguez said the Latin and Caribbean nations backed the
  Reagan Administration's opposition to many of the sections in
  the legislation, including those to curb imports and to require
  retaliation for foreign unfair trade practices.
      He told reporters the committee would likely mount a
  campaign to fight the legislation when it comes up for debate
  on the Senate floor, expected next week.
      Rodriguez said ""the region needs trade to continue
  development.  We hope this need will not be affected negatively
  by trade legislation.""
      Rodriguez said: ""we need to keep the market opens -
  especially the U.S. market - to obtain the necessary foreign
  exchange not only to service the debt but also to continue
  national development progress.""
      President Reagan has said he would veto any legislation he
  termed ""protectionist,"" and his aides now are mounting a effort
  to water down some of the objectionable provisions in the
  legislation.
      Asked whether Reagan was ready to cast a veto, Rodriguez
  said as yet ""the administration is not in a veto frame of mind.""

test/19918,"ISRAEL MINISTER SEES INCREASED EXPORTS TO U.S.
  Israel's exports to the U.S. can and
  must double over the next five years if the mideast nation's
  goal of economic independence is to be achieved, said Gad
  Yaacobi, Israeli minister of Economy and Communication.
      Speaking before an American-Israel Chamber of Commerce
  seminar, Yaacobi said that in 1986 Israeli exports to the U.S.
  were over 2.3 billion dlrs or about one-third of Israel's total
  exports, while imports from the U.S. were around 1.8 billion
  dlrs or roughly one-sixth of the total.
      ""I am convinced that Israel exports to the U.S. can reach
  five billion dlrs in the next five years, if we learn to
  function in the American marketplace and place greater emphasis
  on product quality,"" Yaacobi said.
      While the weakening of the dollar vis-a-vis European
  currencies is a ""bottleneck to increasing exports to the U.S.,""
  Yaacobi said he expects Israel to extend its recent trend
  toward higher U.S. exports.
      In the last ten years, Israeli exports to the U.S. rose
  fivefold, from 417 mln dlrs to 2.3 billion in 1986, while
  imports rose from 888 mln dlrs to 1.8 billion last year.
      Yaacobi said export growth must increase ten to eleven pct
  annually, the rate achieved until the 1973 Yom Kippur War.
       He said that the U.S./Israel Free Trade agreement, passed
  last year and eliminating all duties and other commercial
  restrictions between the two nations through 1994, would
  continue to facilitate the desired export growth.
      Dual agreements included in the FTA allow Israel to act as
  an economic bridge between the U.S. and Europe, enabling U.S.
  firms to export to Europe at lower cost if a certain percentage
  of the exported is produced in Israel, and vice-versa.
      Yaacobi said that tensions among the nations of the middle
  east was one of the main reasons Israel had not yet been able
  to achieve its economic potential.
      Since 1973 the U.S. has given Israel 25 billion dlrs in
  aid, but most of it went to defense expenditures and financing
  military conflicts ""which were imposed on Israel,"" he said.
      Short of achieving Israel's full growth potential, however,
  Yaccobi said it would still be possible to achieve economic
  independence by 1993 or 1994, based on the assumption that
  exports can be doubled from 1986 levels in that time period.

test/16357,"TAIWAN ANNOUNCES NEW ROUND OF IMPORT TARIFF CUTS
  Taiwan announced plans for another round
  of import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before trade
  talks with Washington which officials described as a move to
  help balance trade with the United States.
      Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry's
  Customs Administration Department, told reporters the list of
  products included 60 items asked by Washington.
      ""The move is part of our government efforts to encourage
  imports from our trading partners, particularly from the United
  States,"" he said.
      He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinet
  that the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles,
  apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cut
  by between five and 50 pct.
      The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursday
  and the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting
  on April 20, he added.
      Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700
  foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce its
  growing trade surplus with the United States, the island's
  largest trading partner.
      Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts and
  pressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge trade
  deficit with Taipei.
      Washington's deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6
  billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985. It
  widened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78
  billion a year earlier, Taiwan's official figures show.
      Today's announcement came before a departure later today of
  a 15-member Taiwan delegation for Washington for a series of
  trade talks with U.S. Officials.
      The delegation's leader, Vincent Siew, told reporters last
  night he was leaving with ""a heavy heart,"" meaning that he would
  face tough talks in Washington because of rising protectionist
  sentiments in the U.S. Congress. Taiwan's 1986 trade surplus
  with Washington was the third largest, after Japan and Canada.
      Siew said the talks, starting on April 14, would cover U.S.
  Calls for Taiwan to open its market to American products,
  purchases of major U.S. Machinery and power plant equipment,
  import tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property.
      ""I am afraid this time we have to give more than take from
  our talks with the U.S.,"" he said without elaborating.

test/19128,"OPEC PRESIDENT LUKMAN EXPECTS SHORT, CALM MEETING
  OPEC conference president Rilwanu Lukman
  said he expects next week's ministerial meeting in Vienna to be
  brief and calm and that OPEC's current price and production
  agreement may only need a slight review.
      ""I expect the meeting in Vienna to be short and calm,""
  Lukman, who is also Nigerian oil minister, told reporters here
  ahead of his departure on Sunday for the conference, which
  starts June 25.
      ""We already have an agreement which may need only a slight
  review,"" Lukman said.
      The agreement reached at a long session of OPEC ministers
  in December last year pegged the group's crude oil output at
  15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 at fixed prices of around 18
  dlrs a barrel.
      Since then prices have risen from 15 dlrs in December to
  just above the official OPEC levels, with oil industry analysts
  firmly convinced the organisation will maintain the agreement
  to keep the market stable.
      ""I myself believe that OPEC will tend to take a position to
  strengthen the gains we have made so far,"" Lukman said.
      He declined to say if the current ceiling should be
  maintained or raised to 16.6 mln bpd for the third quarter and
  18.3 mln for the fourth as provisionally agreed last December.
      ""Whatever decision we arrive at will be guided by our
  collective will to keep the market strong,"" he said.
      He said non-OPEC member Norway, which he visited two weeks
  ago, had pledged further cooperation with the group and this
  was significant for its members.
      Lukman said heavy destocking by consumers early this year
  when OPEC's fixed price regime came into effect and a
  restocking now for the winter was responsible for current
  market strength.

  Ghana has lifted a ban on rice and maize
  imports due to crop problems caused by unusually dry weather,
  the official Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported today.
      Secretary for Finance and Economic Planning Kwesi Botchwey
  made the announcement last night while accepting 7,891 tonnes
  of rice worth about four mln dlrs under a Japanese food aid
  programme.
      The lifting of the ban, imposed earlier this year, follows
  government concern over ""lower than average rainfall in southern
  Ghana and its implications for the major harvest.""
      Botchwey said rain has been lacking in major cereal growing
  areas throughout the south this year. The Ministry of
  Agriculture has predicted a fall of at least 25 pct in all
  major staple crops including maize, rice and cassava.
      GNA quoted Botchwey as saying that while the consequences
  of current reduced rainfall will be nowhere near the drought
  experiences of 1982/83 the government has taken steps to
  alleviate anticipated food production shortfalls.
      The failure of seasonal rains has already seriously
  affected drinking water supplies, farming and fishing in parts
  of the Central and Volta regions of Ghana where rivers have
  dried up.

      The sources were quoted as saying that after Opec had in
  March demonstrated its commitment to quota agreements, some
  members had raised output last week. It gave no details.
      ""Dealers in oil markets were now waiting to see if Opec was
  able to control production, or whether the days of cheating and
  producing over quotas has begun anew,"" it reported.
     ""The sources warned that maybe the (price of a) barrel of oil
  will fall below 18, perhaps 17.80 dlrs this week or next if
  there is no control on supplies.
      ""The sources believed a return of oil below 18 dlrs a barrel
  may open the doors for international oil companies to pressure
  Opec over contract prices, similar to the struggle last March,""
  it said, apparently referring to resistance by buyers to lift
  from Qatar unless it gave price discounts.
      ""More than one official has warned Opec would find its
  solidarity under scrutiny by the end of April or start of May,""
  it said, noting demand usually fell with the onset of summer.

test/19684,"CHANCES OF DIRECT U.S.-IRAN GULF CLASH SEEN LOW
  U.S. moves to increase its warships in
  and around the Mideast Gulf could trigger more attacks on
  unprotected merchant ships but run little risk of sparking a
  direct military clash with Iran, diplomats said.
      They said the American decision inevitably carries some
  risk of armed confrontation, but Iran -- despite its blunt
  rhetoric -- would want to avoid this as much as Washington.
      ""As Iran knows very well, what America is bringing into the
  Gulf could do serious damage,"" said one western diplomat.
      Diplomats see the greatest potential danger in more attacks
  on ""soft targets"" such as merchant shipping not protected by
  American or other western navy vessels patrolling the Gulf.
      The risk of Iranian attack on U.S. Warships or Kuwaiti oil
  tankers carrying the U.S. Flag and under naval escort is rated
  by diplomats as low. However, ""There is the threat that the
  Iranians, seeing these heavily protected U.S.-flag tankers,
  will go for softer targets,"" one diplomat said.
      Tehran Radio quoted Iran's top defence spokesman Ali Akbar
  Hashemi Rafsanjani as saying yesterday that Washington was
  ""moving to the brink of an armed encounter with us.""
      The U.S. is increasing its Gulf fleet from seven to 10
  warships and sending the refurbished battleship Missouri to
  patrol just outside the Strait of Hormuz.
      The build-up ties in with U.S. plans to start escorting
  Kuwaiti oil tankers next month, which have been re-registered
  to fly the American flag to give them naval protection.
      Shipping serving Kuwait has come under repeated attack by
  Iran, angered at the emirate's war backing of Iraq.
      Concern in the region has mounted over the threat posed by
  Chinese-made Silkworm missiles, which the U.S. says Iran is
  preparing to deploy near the Strait of Hormuz.
      The Missouri, with its four-escort flotilla, is likely to
  make Iran think twice about using the missiles, diplomats said.
      A military source in the Gulf has said Iran also set up a
  launching site for the Silkworms on captured Iraqi soil in the
  Faw peninsula, within range of Kuwait.
      ""But anything that went as far as a direct attack on Kuwaiti
  territory would be a very serious escalation"" likely moving
  world opinion against Iran, remarked one.
      Some diplomats believe Iran could also consider carrying
  out reprisals against the United States outside the Gulf.
      Rafsanjani, who is also parliamentary leader, predicted
  last Friday ""a river of blood"" throughout the world in the event
  of any U.S. strike against Iran.
      Western diplomats said Iran, which Washington has accused
  of being behind state-sponsored terrorism, had no demonstrable
  capacity to carry out attacks in the U.S. itself.
      Diplomats saw few potential targets in Lebanon now that
  most Americans have left in the wake of kidnappings linked to
  pro-Iranian groups. But Europe and Asia were potential
  trouble-spots, and Kuwait was one of the most obvious targets.
      Any backlash was likely to take the form of sabotage or
  other action to make it difficult to blame Iran, they added.

  Shares of Dome Petroleum Ltd posted
  their biggest gain in months in the U.S. and Canada as stock
  markets foresaw a takeover tug-of-war beginning for the
  debt-heavy company.
      Dome rose 1/4 to 1-1/8 on the American Stock Exchange and
  gained 31 cents to 1.44 Canadian dlrs on the Toronto Stock
  Exchange, where it was the most active stock. It rose as high
  as 1.50 dlrs in Toronto during the day. In recent months, Dome
  has normally moved by only a few cents per day.

  Canadian (3.22 billion U.S.) bid for all of Dome's assets, but
  Dome, which is based in Calgary, Alberta, said it is also still
  talking with two other companies, which it refuses to identify.
      Market analysts today said the other two firms are believed
  to be foreign oil companies, noting that TransCanada yesterday
  stressed that its bid is ""a Canadian solution to the financial
  difficulties of Dome Petroleum.""
      ""The talk is about Conoco, which is controlled by DuPont

  interest in 1975 and could be getting back in,"" said Wilf Gobert

  in recent reports that Amoco Corp &lt;AN> has also been in talks
  with Dome.
      Representatives of Atlantic Richfield, British Petroleum,
  Conoco and Amoco were not immediately available for comment.
      Gobert characterized the market action in Dome today as ""awfully

  shareholders stock in a new subsidiary, which it valued at 1.10
  dlrs Canadian per common share.
      Under the offer, current Dome common and preferred
  shareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary, which
  would own and operate all Dome's former assets. TransCanada
  would own 80 pct.
      However, Bryson said the market may be looking at the
  potential for shares in a publicly-traded subsidiary. ""The
  TransCanada offer has quite a bit of upside potential for Dome,""
  he said.
      Gobert said he believes the TransCanada offer is ""at the
  upper end of what I thought somebody would pay for Dome.""
      The TransCanada proposal would pay Dome's creditors 3.87
  billion Canadian dlrs (2.90 billion U.S. dlrs), with another
  one billion Canadian dlrs (750 mln U.S. dlrs) available to
  secured creditors if the Dome subsidiary earns profits above a
  certain level. TransCanada would not detail the profit level.
      Dome currently is seeking to restructure about six billion
  Canadian dlrs (4.5 billion U.S. dlrs) in debt, which it took on
  several years ago when oil prices were high and the company
  wanted to expand.
      ""There has been speculation that Dome's assets are capable
  of supporting debt of three to four billion dlrs, so on that
  basis, the TransCanada offer would be at the upper end of that,""
  Gobert said.
      Dome's debt troubles have often obscured the fact that it
  is a major player in the Canadian oil and gas field. It holds
  reserves of about 176 mln barrels of crude oil and 3.9 billion
  cubic feet of natural gas.
      The company also owns or has an interest in 14.2 mln acres
  of oil and gas exploration land in the province of Alberta, the
  heart of Canada's oil industry.
     Dome owns or has an interest in a total of 36.1 mln acres of
  land across Canada.
     The company also has tax credits of about 2.5 billion dlrs
  Canadian (1.9 billion dlrs U.S.). It reported a 1986 loss of
  2.2 billion dlrs (1.65 billion dlrs U.S.), believed to be the
  largest ever by a Canadian company.

test/16163,"BORG-WARNER AGREES TO BUYOUT BY MERRILL LYNCH FIRM
  Borg-Warner &lt;BOR> Corp, facing an
  unwanted offer from GAF Corp &lt;GAF>, agreed to a 4.23 billion
  dlr buyout offer from a company to be formed by &lt;Merrill Lynch
  Capital Partners Inc>.
      Borg-Warner and Merrill said yesterday they entered a
  definitive merger agreement, under which a subsidiary of the
  new company, &lt;AV Holdings Corp>, will begin a 48.50 dlr per
  share cash tender offer today for 77.6 mln shares or 89 pct of
  Borg-Warner common stock.
      The offer will be followed by a merger in which each
  remaining share will be converted into 19.75 dlrs cash and
  54.25 dlrs principal amount of AV Holdings junior subordinated
  discount debentures.
      As a result of the merger, Borg-Warner will become a wholly
  owned subsidiary of AV Holdings. A Borg-Warner spokeswoman said
  members of management do not plan to participate in the
  transaction, but they will retain their positions with the
  company.
      A spokesman for GAF was unavailable for comment. GAF holds
  19.9 pct of Borg-Warner's shares.
      GAF had said it would offer 46 dlrs per share.
      Borg-Warner's spokeswoman said the company still plans to
  sell its financial services unit, which includes Wells Fargo
  security guards, and the Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.
      Borg-Warner has been the focus of takeover speculation for
  about a year. Corporate raider Irwin Jacobs last year proposed
  a takeover of the firm and until recently held 10 pct of the
  stock. Following the GAF offer, analysts had calculated breakup
  values for the company in the low 50 dlrs per share range and
  speculated an offer would have to be sweetened.
      In its statement, Borg-Warner said its board endorsed the
  Merrill offer and it recommended that shareholders tender their
  shares. The board received opinions on the offer from its
  advisors, First Boston Corp and Goldman, Sachs and Co.
      James Burke, president of Merrill Lynch Capital Partners,
  said, ""We are very pleased to have entered into this transaction
  with Borg-Warner. We are looking forward to working with the
  employees of Borg-Warner and to Borg-Warner maintaining its
  strong presence in the Chicago community.""
      Merrill Lynch will be the dealer-manager for the offer,
  which expires at midnight EDT May 8 (0400 GMT, May 9), subject
  to conditions, including the completion of necessary financing
  arrangements.
      The offer is also subject to a minimum 44.25 mln shares, or
  51 pct of the outstanding shares, being tendered.
      Merrill Lynch and certain affiliates have committed to
  provide 200 mln dlrs in AV Holdings equity and 870 mln in
  subordinated financing and forward underwriting commitments.
      Merrill Lynch said that following discussions with
  commercial banks it is confident it can obtain the rest of the
  financing required to complete the transaction.
      The junior subordinated discount debentures to be issued in
  the merger will carry a 13 pct coupon and will begin paying
  cash interest after five years.
      The debentures will be redeemable at the company's option
  for the first six years at 105 pct, during the seventh year at
  102.5 pct and after that at 100 pct of the principal amount.
      The junior subordinated discount debentures have a maturity
  of 20 years and are entitled to a sinking fund commencing in
  the 16th year designed to retire 60 pct of the issue before
  maturity.
      Borg-Warner will also redeem all of its outstanding 4.50
  dlrs cumulative preferred stock, series A, for 100 dlrs per
  share. Holders who wish to participate in the offer must first
  convert their preferred stock into Borg-Warner common stock.
      The board of Borg-Warner has also taken steps to redeem its
  poison pill or share purchase rights for five cents per right,
  effective immediately.

  White House Budget chief James
  Miller said he was concerned that the Federal Reserve might
  ""overreact"" to the decline in the value of the U.S. dollar by
  raising interest rates, a move he said could cause a recession
  next year.
      ""Our greatest danger is overreaction,"" Miller told newspaper
  reporters yesterday. ""I'm concerned about the Fed's
  overreaction. I'm concerned about what I see in recent data
  showing a substantial fall in the money supply.""
      Edwin Dale, Miller's spokesman, said the remarks, published
  in the New York Times today, were accurate.
      Miller said he was concerned the Fed might overreact to
  signals of rising inflation by tightening credit -- a move he
  said could have ""political consequences.""
      The White House budget chief appeared to be referring to
  the effect an economic slowdown could have on the presidential
  and congressional elections next year.
      ""My fear is that if we get into a recession we are in deep
  soup, and there is no question about it,"" he said.
      Miller said an economic slowdown could lead to lower tax
  revenues and a widening of the budget deficit.
      Miller's remarks reflected concern that the U.S. central
  bank might feel compelled to tighten credit as a means of
  bolstering the dollar.
      Both Treasury Secretary James Baker and Federal Reserve
  Board Chairman Paul Volcker recently have warned that further
  declines in the value of the U.S. dollar could jeopardize
  global growth prospects.
      U.S. officials have urged Japan and West Germany to
  stimulate economic growth in their countries -- a move that
  could boost U.S. exports and relieve trade protectionist
  pressures in the United States.

      In a suit filed in U.S. District Court, International
  Multifoods said Bregman Partners and its affiliates, who
  reportedly hold 7.4 pct of the company's shares, tried to
  induce Multifood's management to join them in an effort to take
  the company private and give controlling interest to Bregman
  Partners. Bregman Partners include the interests of the
  Belzberg families of Canada.
      The complaint also discloses that on each occasion,
  Multifoods management rejected the group's overtures.
      Multifoods is asking Bregman's group to divest its shares
  in open market sales in a manner not to further disrupt the
  market place, according to the suit. The suit seeks
  compensatory and punitive damages in an amount to be
  determined.
      In addition, Multifoods is seeking to stop Bregman Partners
  from acquiring any more stock, or voting the shares it
  reportedly owns, the suit said.
      According to Multifoods, the actions proposed by Bregman
  Partners would prevent shareholders from realizing the full
  benefits of the company's restructuring.
      In the past three years, Multifoods has substantially
  altered its domestic business mix by divesting its U.S.

  The Roy Disney family disclosed in a
  filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it made
  a bid to acquire Holly Sugar Corp for a package of cash and
  securities.
      Shamrock Holdings of California Inc, a Disney family
  company, said it submitted the bid on April 8 to Salomon
  Brothers Inc, Holly Sugar's investment banker.
      The offer was for 45 dlrs in cash, securities with a face
  value of 70 dlrs, and a ""contingent payment certificate"" that
  would pay out as much as 70 dlrs over a 20-year period for each
  share of Holly Sugar outstanding.
      The Disney family already holds 101,300 Holly Sugar shares
  or 9.0 pct of the total outstanding following purchases of
  12,500 shares March 13-April 17, Shamrock told the SEC.
      Shamrock said it had asked for certain information about
  Holly Sugar's financial condition but had been turned down. It
  said its offer was therefore subject to further discussions.
      ""Once we have had an opportunity to complete our due
  diligence evaluation of the company, including inspections of
  certain facilities and meetings with key management personnel,
  we would be prepared to negotiate all aspects of our proposal,
  including price,"" it said in its April 8 letter.

test/17966,"U.K. RESERVES LIFT HOPES OF FURTHER BASE RATE CUT
  The record 4.9 billion dlrs rise in U.K.
  Reserves in May to a total 34.7 billion has lifted hopes for a
  further cut in bank base lending rates after the June 11
  general election, market analysts said.
      Sterling would have risen on the much better than expected
  number but for market nerves about the poll outcome, they said.
      But the weight of foreign currency and gold reserves now
  available to the authorities to support the pound should curb
  any market tendency to panic if U.K. Opinion polls show the
  ruling Conservative Party's lead slipping, they added.
      ""We have been intervening to a very much greater extent than
  we have done hitherto,"" Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
  said at a news conference today, commenting on the news of the
  record reserves rise.
      He put the U.K. Intervention in the context of the Louvre
  accord between leading industrial nations to stabilise the
  dollar, partly through direct intervention on foreign
  exchanges. ""We have been playing a very full part ourselves,"" he
  said.
      But market analysts see the recent upward pressure on
  sterling, and consequent need for official sales to damp down
  its rise, more in the light of local factors.
      Steven Bell, chief economist at Morgan Grenfell Securities,
  said that corporate money has been flowing back into Britain
  amid hopes of another Conservative government, after fears last
  autumn of a Labour election victory sent it flooding out.
      U.K. Portfolio investment is also returning, while foreign
  buyers see U.K. Growth propects and high bond yields as
  attractive. They will be strong buyers of U.K. Assets, notably
  equities, once the election is out of the way, Bell said.
      Analysts see this pressure as the main hope for lower
  interest rates, as the government is expected to try to reverse
  the loss of export competitiveness caused by a strong pound.
      Today, however, the pound hardly moved on the reserves
  news, dipping on its trade-weighted index against a basket of
  currencies from 73.1 pct of its 1975 value at 1000 GMT to 73.0
  pct at 1100 GMT, half an hour after the figures were released.
      ""The market doesn't want to do anything because of the
  election,"" commented an economist at a big U.S. Investment bank.
      Several dealers and analysts added that market forecasts of
  a rise in reserves of between one and three billion dlrs had
  overestimated the amount of pound sales that were likely to
  have been disguised by swap arrangements or transactions on the
  forward market.
      The market also seemed to have overestimated the amount of
  sterling the Bank of England bought at the end of May to smooth
  the pound's sudden downturn, while some of the intervention
  reported in May probably occurred in April, they said.
      The key three months interbank money market rates eased
  about 1/8 point, reflecting cautious hopes that the downtrend
  in U.K. Interest rates will be revived following the reserves
  news, analysts said.
      Government bond prices initially firmed, but the market was
  muted as traders worried about the funding implications of
  another huge rise in reserves, they added.
      Morgan Grenfell's Bell forecast a half point base rate cut
  from the current nine pct level soon after the election, so
  long as poll projections of another Conservative victory prove
  accurate, with another half point later.
      Justin Silverton, equity economist at Credit Suisse
  Buckmaster and Moore, said a full point reduction might be
  possible. ""Sterling will be held down by interest rate cuts in
  future, rather than this active intervention,"" he predicted.
      Kevin Boakes of Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged cautioned
  against over-optimistic forecasts, but agreed a half point cut
  looked likely.
      A cut before the election has been virtually ruled out.
      ""The Bank (of England) is both worried about the political
  problem of cutting rates during an election campaign ... And
  has signalled some worry about broad money (growth),"" said Robin
  Marshall, chief U.K. Economist at Chase Manhattan Securities.
      He said the 10 billion dlrs increase in total reserves in
  the past seven months may foreshadow full U.K. Entry into the
  European Monetary System.
      But Bell said the authorities would like to see another 10
  or 15 billion dlrs in the reserves before joining, if they did
  so. But, unlike many analysts, he doubted the U.K. Will go in.

  shareholders for approval at an extraordinary general meeting
  on May 26, the ANZ said in a statement.

  September 30. The group paid 31 cents a share and 133.1 mln

  OPEC's credibility faces fresh scrutiny
  in coming weeks amid signs of a significant rise in supplies of
  oil to international oil markets, the Kuwait daily al-Qabas
  said.
      In an article headlined, ""Gulf oil sources say Middle East
  production up 1.4 mln bpd,"" it warned OPEC's official prices
  could face fresh pressure from international oil companies
  seeking cheaper supplies.
      It did not say whether only OPEC or both OPEC and other
  producers were behind the reported rise in Mideast output. Nor
  did it specify if the sources were official or other contacts. 
     ""The sources said the credibility of OPEC would come under
  fresh scrutiny from today (Monday), with activity in the
  European and American markets,"" the daily said.
      The sources were quoted as saying that after OPEC had in
  March demonstrated its commitment to quota agreements, some
  members had raised output last week. It gave no details.
      ""Dealers in oil markets were now waiting to see if Opec was
  able to control production, or whether the days of cheating and
  producing over quotas has begun anew,"" it said.
      The sources warned that ""maybe the (price of a) barrel of
  oil will fall below 18, perhaps 17.80 dlrs this week or next if
  there is no control on supplies,"" it said.
      ""The sources believed a return of oil below 18 dlrs a barrel
  may open the doors for international oil companies to pressure
  OPEC over contract prices, similar to the struggle last March,""
  it said, apparently referring to resistance by buyers to lift
  from Qatar unless it gave price discounts.
      ""More than one official has warned OPEC would find its
  solidarity under scrutiny by the end of April or start of May,""
  it said, noting demand usually fell with the onset of summer.

  and pay shareholders a dividend of 60 dlrs per share, lowering
  the company's net worth. The Coniston group, which owns 13 pct
  of Allegis stock, has said that it would seek shareholder
  consents to remove 13 of the 16 Allegis directors. The group
  had said it would consider breaking up Allegis into its
  airline, hotel and vehicle rental components if it succeeded.
      The Coniston group said it expects to make a further

      Wall Street analysts and traders had not expected Coniston

test/20262,"U.K. CREDIT POLICY SEEN STEADY, DESPITE BANK DATA
  An unexpectedly heavy 4.4 billion stg
  surge in U.K. September sterling bank lending is unlikely to
  nudge the Bank of England towards tightening monetary policy as
  long as sterling remains in its present robust state,
  economists said.
      An acute crisis of confidence in equity markets over the
  past two days will in any case subdue personal consumer credit
  demand which has largely been behind growth in lending.
      ""In the normal course of events the markets would have been
  extremely worried about that figure,"" noted Peter Spencer, U.K.
  Economist with Credit Suisse First Boston.
      After an initial dip in reaction to the bank lending data,
  which compared won stg August rise, U.K.
  Government bonds (gilts) soared as investors continued to flee
  from plummetting equities into the relative security of
  government securities.
      Equity markets dropped sharply on the news, touching a
  day's low of 1,766.7 on the FTSE 100 index after the data,
  before staging a recovery. Sterling held its buoyant tone
  throughout.
      U.K. Money market rates, in a similarly calm response,
  resumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morning
  after little more than a token blip as the figures came out.
      Noting that such a huge rise in credit extended by banks
  would under other circumstances have prompted market fears of a
  rise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct, ""With
  the financial markets doing what they're doing, that's the last
  thing the Bank of England would want to do,"" Spencer said.
      ""The monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long as
  sterling is firm, the authorities are unlikely to put rates up,""
  said Kevin Boakes, chief U.K. Economist at Greenwell Montagu
  Gilt Edged. Boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow money
  measure M0 to 5.2 pct year-on-year from August's 4.5 pct
  growth, which he said must cause some concern at the Treasury.
      But ""The fact that overall broad money growth has slowed
  down is a rather encouraging sign,"" noted Paul Temperton, U.K.
  Economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. He pointed to a
  fall in the year-on-year growth rate of the M3 broad money
  aggregate to 19.5 pct in September from August's 22 pct.
      It was concern about credit growth which prompted the Bank
  of England to engineer a one point rise in U.K. Bank base rates
  to 10 pct in early August, caution endorsed subsequently by
  news of a massive 4.9 billion stg July rise in bank lending.
      Temperton noted that a particular focus of bank worry in
  that period had been the behaviour of U.K. Asset markets.
      Housing and equities were the key two asset markets in
  influencing consumer behaviour, he said.
      In the light of the precipitous falls on U.K. Equity
  markets in the past few days, ""There will almost certainly be a
  straightforward impact on consumer spending and on retail
  sales,"" Temperton said.
      ""Almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth in
  consumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues,"" he added.
      ""I think the stock market has decided that the bank lending
  figure is a thing of the past...We are talking about a very
  serious panic and a flight to quality,"" Spencer said.
      A U.K. Treasury official said that it was important to look
  at all the monetary information, not just the bank lending,
  adding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowly
  than bank lending.
      Senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lending
  was evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavy
  personal sector borrowing.
      Figures from the Banking Information Service showed
  personal sector lending by U.K. Clearing banks rose by 1.66
  billion stg in September after a 978 mln stg August rise. Much
  of the rise reflected quarterly interest payments.

      ""I think at the summit meeting in Venice what we ought to be
  trying to do is to get the other major industrial nations that
  are involved to bring interest rates down, say, one pct,""
  Bentsen told NBC Television's ""Meet the Press.""
      Bentsen said coordinated rate cuts could take ""billions off
  the debt service of the Latin countries"" and help ease
  protectionist pressures in the industrial countries.
      Bentsen also South Korea and Taiwan should be pressured to
  revalue their currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar.
      ""You take the Taiwanese, with an enormous capital surplus,
  enormous trade surplus, and we've had very little cooperation
  there,"" he said.

  same television network he agreed that the U.S. dollar had not
  fallen enough against the currencies of some countries.
      ""I think that more does have to be done there in
  negotiations with the countries involved, the so-called NICs
  (newly industrialized countries),"" he said.
      Darman said such negotiations with newly industrialized
  countries were underway privately.

  Telex Corp said its board adopted a
  shareholder rights plan which will allow shareholders to
  purchase one common share for two dlrs if a hostile group
  acquires 15 pct or more of the company.
      However, the company said the plan will not be triggered by
  purchases pursuant to the 65 dlrs a share tender offer
  commenced on October 9 by a unit of TLX Partners, a group
  controlled by New York financier Asher Edelman.
      It said the rights will be distributed on a one for one
  basis to all shareholders as of October 30 and may be redeemed
  before they become exercisable at five cents per right.
      The company said the rights will expire on the later of
  February 17 next year or 60 days from the date they become
  exercisable. It said the plan was intended to protect
  stockholders against any attempt to take unfair advantage of
  the recent decline in stock prices or to use abusive tactics
  such as market accumulations which would interfere with its
  ability to maximize stockholder value.
      The rights become exercisable if any person or group
  acquires 15 pct or more of the company's common stock other
  than through an all cash tender offer for all outstanding
  shares at 65 dlrs per share.
       It said the rights will also not become exercisable if the
  company is acquired by a group under an agreement made with its
  board.
       A spokeswoman told Reuters the company would have an
  official response to Edelman's bid by Friday, Oct 23.

test/15442,"EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE
  European currency markets reacted quietly
  to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers
  ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to
  surprise that the markets should have expected so much.
      The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies
  and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which
  reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency
  stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.
      Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining
  broadly entrenched in its current trading range.
      ""The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84
  marks,"" said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank
  AG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.
      However, she said the dollar could break out of the range
  with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.
  Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.
      Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd
  in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against
  the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,
  possibly to 140 yen.
      A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects
  a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.
      London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb
  underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative
  sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank
  operators to test the downside.
      Concern that finance ministers and officials still in
  Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of
  currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with
  worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the
  near term, the traders said.
      Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the
  communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's
  downward trend.
      Traders in several centres said the market would look for
  fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to
  defend current ranges, which the communique said were ""broadly
  consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy
  intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.""
      Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said
  ""They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon."" The
  U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.
      However, some dealers said London-based operators would be
  unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long
  Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825
  marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.
      Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said
  the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable
  market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme
  volatility seen in the first few months of this year.
      One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the
  communique made clear the leading nations did not want a
  further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.
      The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to
  1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre
  accord's supposed currency target range.
      A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were
  ready for a period of ""mainly sideways movement.""
      But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique
  contributing to greater stability.
      ""Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big
  boost,"" said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he
  expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks
  in the next three months.
      A Swiss monetary source, who asked not to be named, said
  the communique had been in line with realistic expectations and
  should not have produced disappointment.
      ""The problem is that the changes needed in fiscal and trade
  policies to redress current imbalances are of a different
  timescale than currency markets operate on,"" the source told
  Reuters, ""This is a political process which takes time.""
      Alois Schwietert, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp in
  Basle, also questioned the tone of disappointment evident on
  currency markets today. ""Did people really expect a patent
  remedy?"" he asked.
      Bank economists in Paris noted yesterday's meeting was only
  the first in a series and said the market would watch carefully
  in the next few weeks for any changes in positions.
      A senior economist with Banque Indosuez said the focus was
  now on trade and growth rather than interest rates. Any move by
  Japan and West Germany to boost their economic growth could
  lead to a quick change in the U.S. Position.
      Dealers in all centres agreed that markets would be wary in
  pushing the dollar too far too quickly in the coming months
  while central banks appear resolved to use their muscle to
  support the Paris accord.

test/18360,"NEAR TERM STRENGTH SEEN FOR CURRENCY FUTURES
  Currency futures are likely to move
  higher following the sharp rally today after President Reagan
  announced that Paul Volcker would not accept a third term as
  Federal Reserve Chairman and that Alan Greenspan was nominated
  as his replacement, currency analysts said.
      Contrary to predictions before the Volcker resignation,
  analysts are calling for higher currency futures prices between
  now and the June 8 Venice economic summit.
      In particular, uncertainty about Greenspan's attitude to
  the dollar could undermine sentiment toward the U.S. currency,
  analysts said.
      Greenspan said today that the dollar appeared to be nearing
  a bottom, but the market will bear in mind his remarks in
  Chicago last week that the dollar's recent move upward was a
  technical reaction and that it would trade significantly lower,
  analysts said.
     
      ""Disappointment of European central bankers over the
  appointment will be used as an opportunity to sell the dollar
  lower,"" said Manufacturers Hanover Futures vice president Carol
  Mackoff.
      ""The international community will not like this
  appointment,"" as it suggests the possibility that the U.S.
  budget deficit is too much of a burden on monetary policy and
  that Volcker was unable to get the commitment he sought to
  reduce the deficit, added Merrill Lynch Economics analyst David
  Horner.
       Furthermore, ""that Greenspan was not named two months ago
  suggests that he was not the Administration's first choice --
  and that the status of his appointment was as a bridesmaid,""
  Horner said.
      A declining dollar scenario with higher currency futures
  prior to and throughout the Venice meetings would be mitigated
  only by concrete action as opposed to ""jawboning"" at the G-7
  summit, he said.
      But G-7 finance ministers, judged by recent statements, may
  be at an impasse, analysts said.
      Japan and West Germany today reiterated that neither
  planned further interest rate cuts, despite pressure from the
  U.S. to do so, Mackoff said.
      The U.S., on the other hand, has not cut its budget deficit
  as Japan and West Germany have urged, she said.
      Should G-7 members force a U.S. commitment to cut its
  budget deficit in the next two years, a further decline in the
  dollar could be forestalled, Horner said.
      However, ""the impact from Venice will be nothing if nothing
  changes,"" Horner said.
      Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. analyst Craig Sloane
  said European currencies will likely move to the higher end of
  their 1987 ranges after today's sharp advance.
      For the next two weeks, Sloan calls for September yen
  futures to advance toward the 0.007200 area. He said September
  marks could close in on 0.5700 as an upside target, while Swiss
  francs could climb to a range between 0.6900 and 0.6950.

  Losses for Volkswagen AG
  &lt;VOWG.F>, VW, linked to an alleged foreign currency fraud will
  not exceed the 480 mln marks provision already made, a VW
  spokesman said.
      The spokesman was commenting after VW had confirmed it
  would pay an unchanged 10 mark dividend for ordinary shares on
  1986 business, despite the provision.
      One West German newspaper today quoted foreign currency
  dealers in Frankfurt as speculating that the total losses from
  the currency affair could be as high as 1.5 billion marks, but
  the VW spokesman described 480 mln marks as an ""upper limit.""
      VW said in a statement following today's supervisory board
  meeting that it had discussed the foreign currency scandal in
  detail, and was setting up a new probe into its foreign
  currency activities to be carried out by an unnamed auditing
  company.
      VW has said computer programs were erased and documents
  were faked in the alleged fraud in which it believes
  transactions intended to protect it against possible foreign
  currency losses were not completed.
      VW's former foreign currency chief Burkhard Junger was
  arrested on Monday on suspicion of embezzlement and of having
  evaded justice.
      Earlier VW had said that its 1986 results would match 1985
  profits. VW's group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks and
  parent company net was 477 mln marks. It also said it recommend
  an unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company has
  also set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares,
  which were issued last year. Analysts have described the held
  dividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders.
      VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5
  billion marks, with the result that its total dividend payment
  on 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985,
  since the new capital was in preference shares.
      The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves in
  order to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels. At
  the end of 1985, VW had parent company reserves of slightly
  less than three billion marks.

  U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
  has asked Japan to open its farm market further to help
  Washington cut its trade deficit and ease protectionist
  pressures, an Agriculture Ministry official told reporters.
      Hideo Maki, Director General of the ministry's Economic
  Affairs Bureau, quoted Lyng as telling Agriculture Minister
  Mutsuki Kato that the removal of import restrictions would help
  Japan as well as the United States.
      The meeting with Kato opened a 12-day visit to Japan by
  Lyng, who is here to dicuss farm trade.
      However, Maki quoted Kato as replying that Japan was
  already the world's largest grain importer.
      Kato added Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Grain and
  depended on domestic output for only 53 pct of its food
  requirements in 1985.
      Lyng said the U.S. Put high priority on talks on 12 farm
  products named in U.S. Complaints against Japan to the General
  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) last year, as well as on
  beef, citrus products and rice.
      Kato said Japan will maintain its current level of
  self-sufficiency and will try not to produce surplus rice
  because potential production is higher than domestic demand.
      The world farm market suffers from surpluses because of
  rising production by exporting countries, he added.
      Lyng said the U.S. Has been trying to reduce farm product
  output with expensive programs, Maki said.
      Maki said the U.S. And Japan will hold detailed discussions
  on each trade item as well as a new round of GATT trade talks
  at a meeting on April 20, in which U.S. Trade Representative
  Clayton Yeutter will join.

  Oil prices would skyrocket for a time if
  conflict in the Gulf closed the Strait of Hormuz, but oil
  supplies could be adjusted to take care of world demand,
  Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said.
      He made no explicit reference to the latest U.S. Military
  action in the Gulf.
      But in an address to a conference of the Indonesian
  Petroleum Association, he said, ""If worst comes to worst and say
  the flow of oil through the Straits of Hormuz is completely
  shut off, I believe the world oil supply, given time to adjust,
  can take care of the situation.""
      ""But this is not to say that prices, at least for a short
  duration, will not skyrocket as speculators take advantage of
  the situation,"" he declared.
      Tensions in the Gulf, however, usually had a relatively
  short-term impact on prices, he added.
      Assessing future price trends, he said, ""Short-term spot
  prices will probably still fluctuate, but they will most likely
  hover around the official Opec price basket of 18 dlrs per
  barrel.
      ""The upward deviations, however, are likely to be greater
  than the downward ones.""
      ""The balance between supply and demand in the short term
  will still be delicate,"" he added. ""Non-Opec production may still
  go up, competing with Opec for the expected additional increase
  in world demand.""
      Subroto, a member of Opec's three-man quota committee which
  has been touring cartel members, said speculation may play
  havoc with spot prices, but Opec was trying to stabilize the
  situation by urging cooperation by non-Opec producers.
      In the medium term, non-Opec production would reach a
  plateau in the early 1990s, leaving Opec much stronger, he
  said.

      Spain is threatened with massive imports from third

  import two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum
  into Spain from third countries this year.
      Around a sixth of this tonnage has so far come in under a

  make direct purchases.
      The sources said Romero urged that other EC countries
  should take some of the imports to prevent disturbance of the
  Spanish market.

  Commission plan for new limits on farm output which if breached
  would mean price cuts unless Spain received some help.

  quarter earnings by 7.2 mln dlrs, or nine cts per share, after

  Security Pacific said it still expects to report first quarter
  earnings higher than the 88 mln dlrs, or 1.11 dlrs per share
  reported for the first quarter of 1986.

  dlrs of loans to Brazil and 73 mln of loans to Ecuador.
      Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs
  of medium- and long-term debt on February 20.
      Ecuador, which has foreign debt of roughly eight billion
  dlrs, has not paid any interest to foreign banks since
  February.
      In March Ecuador said it would suspend interest payments
  for the rest of the year because of an earthquake which halted
  the export of oil, which accounts for about 75 pct the
  country's export revenues.
      In its announcement, Security Pacific said it will record

      The company also said it believes that Brazil will reach an
  agreement with its banks and that interest payments will resume
  later in 1987.

  At least 60,000 tonnes of corn worth 240
  mln pesos have been smuggled into the Philippines over the past
  few months, the Manila Bulletin newspaper said, quoting an
  official in the National Food Authority (NFA).
      The official, who was not named, said a large corn shortage
  and corruption among customs and Coast Guard personnel have
  jeopardised the government's ban on corn imports, which was
  aimed at saving foreign currency.
      The newspaper quoted NFA Marketing Director Jig Tan as
  saying monthly corn consumption stood at about 331,000 tonnes
  against a national stock inventory of 191,732 tonnes.
      Tan said a continuing drought affecting about 49,150
  hectares of corn has led to the loss of 43,725 tonnes of corn
  worth 174.9 mln pesos and contributed to the shortage.
      The newspaper quoted Linda Geraldez, an NFA statistician,
  as saying despite the drought and the shortage, the total
  inventory at the end of the January/June crop season is
  expected to be at least 201,000 tonnes.

  The Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co
  &lt;PLDT.MN> is planning a two-for-one stock split and a 20 pct
  stock dividend later this year to reduce excess market
  buoyancy, Vice-President Sennen Lazo told Reuters.
      Lazo said the stock split would reduce the par value of the
  company's common stock from 10 to five pesos.
      He said the stock split would apply to holders of about 18
  mln common shares of stock on the record date of September 15
  1987. ""The exercise should make our stock more marketable,"" Lazo
  said. ""Now it is beyond the reach of many small investors.""
      PLDT common stock surged from a low of 37 pesos in February
  1986 to 367.50 at close of trading yesterday on the Manila
  Stock Exchange.
      Lazo said the 20 pct stock dividend, payable on October 15,
  would also apply to stockholders on record as of September 15.
      PLDT reported 1986 net income of 1.89 billion pesos, up 68
  pct from 778.9 mln pesos in 1985, on operating revenues of six
  billion pesos, up from 4.7 billion pesos in 1985.
      At end December 1986 the company had 417,100 stockholders.
      A PLDT spokesman said the company's profits are likely to
  be substantial since the government raised its franchise tax to
  three pct from two and to impose a 35 pct corporate income tax
  from which it was previously exempt.
      The government has not so far ordered the implementation of
  the tax decision.
      PLDT is the largest of 58 telephone companies in the

test/15149,"TALKING POINT/BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES &lt;BUR>
  The largest U.S. textile maker focused
  on its own business as its competitors found merger partners,
  but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself
  into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said.
      The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose
  4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and
  Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct
  stake.
      A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly
  acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover
  offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for
  Montreal-based Dominion called the report just ""rumors.""
      Burlington said it did not know if the report was true.
      Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of
  the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if
  Burlington actually came into play.
      Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however,
  added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it
  was looking for a takeover in the U.S.
      Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills
  and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for
  a U.S. acquisition.
      A Dominion spokesman said Canada's largest textile producer
  has been negotiating with ""many"" U.S. textile companies, but
  would not say whether Burlington was among them.
      ""There have been acquisitions in this area. It's not
  unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the
  housecleaning they've done,"" said Eileen Gormley of Thomson
  McKinnon.
      Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets
  and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs
  last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its
  operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign
  competition, Gormley said.
      ""They've pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer,""
  said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial
  fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets
  and other fabric to the auto industry.
      ""In the past, they just spent and never realized the return
  on the outlays they did make,"" she said.
      ""You look at their record over the year, and I think
  they're poised to be more profitable than they had been in the
  past,"" Gormley said.
       She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up
  from 2.01 dlrs per share.
      Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington
  at its current levels.
      Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends
  selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50
  dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings
  basis.
      Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been
  placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share.
      ""After Asher's (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people
  don't find him very credible anymore,"" said one arbitrager.
      Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing
  managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if
  he doesn't win the target company.
      Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky
  Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying
  Ponderosa Inc.
      The stocks of other textile makers rose along with
  Burlington.
      J.P. Stevens &lt;STN> climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest
  Cannon Inc &lt;FLD>, the result of a merger of Fieldcrest and
  Cannon, rose 1-1/8 to 39-3/4. West Point-Pepperell Inc &lt;WPM>
  rose 1-7/8 to 67-1/8.

  Crude oil netback values in complex
  refineries rose sharply in Europe and firmed in the U.S. last
  Friday from the previous week but fell sharply in Singapore,
  according to calculations by Reuters Pipeline.
      The firmer tone to refining margins in Europe and the U.S.
  relected higher prices for petroleum products, particularly
  gasoline, and support from crude oil prices.
      Netback values for crude oil refined in Northern Europe
  rose substantially following strong gains in gasoline prices
  there. Brent is valued at 19.45 dlrs, up 56 cts a barrel or
  three pct from the previous week.
      In the U.S. Gulf, sweet crudes rose in value by 14 cts to
  19.33 dlrs for West Texas Intermediate, up about 0.7 pct.
      Sour grades in the U.S. Gulf showed an increase of 33 cts a
  barrel for Alaska North Slope, up 1.7 pct.
      But netbacks for crude oil refined in Singapore fell
  sharply, down 15 cts to as much as 68 cts a barrel as ample
  distillate supplies weighed on petroleum product prices.
      Attaka in Singapore is valued at 18.55 dlrs, a decline of
  68 cts a barrel or 3.5 pct from the previous week.
      For refineries in the Mediterranean, netback values were
  mostly lower, with declines of seven to 14 cts. The value of
  Kuwait crude fell 14 cts to 18.37 dlrs, while Iranian Light
  fell 11 cts to 19.14 dlrs.
      On the U.S. West Coast, netback values for ANS CIF L.A.
  also jumped sharply, up 40 cts a barrel or 2.2 pct to 18.82
  dlrs on higher gasoline prices.

  Reichhold Chemical Inc said its
  board adopted a warrant dividend plan in which one preferred
  stock purchase right will be distributed as a dividend on each
  common share outstanding.
      The company said its warrant dividend plan is designed to
  protect its shareholders against unsolicted, coercive attempts
  to aquire control without making an adequate offer for all
  shares.
      Reichhold said the adoption is not a response to any
  specific takeover attempt.
      Reichhold said each right will entitle shareholders to buy
  one one-hundreth of a share of a newly created series of
  preferred stock at an initial exercise price of 120 dlrs, with
  dividend and voting rights approximately equal to those of one
  share of the company's common stock.
      The rights will be exercisable only if, without Reichhold's
  prior consent, a person or group a acquires 20 pct or more of
  the voting power or announces a tender offer which would result
  in 20 pct ownership, the company said.
      Reichhold said it is entitled to redeem the rights at five
  cts apiece before a 20 pct position has been acquired, or
  before an existing 20 pct shareholder buys an additional two
  pct or more of the voting power of the company, or in
  connection with certain transactions afterward.
      The tax-free distribution will become effective May 1,
  1987, and will expire 10 years later, the company said.
      Details of the plan are outlined in a letter to be mailed
  to stockholders.

  Thailand's trade deficit widened to 4.5

  year ago, the Business Economics Department said.
      It said Janunary/March imports rose to 65.1 billion baht
  from 58.7 billion. Thailand's improved business climate this
  year resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materials
  and semi-finished products.
      The country's oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in the
  first quarter due to lower oil prices.
      The department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6
  billion baht from 56.6 billion.
      Export growth was smaller than expected due to lower
  earnings from many key commodities including rice whose
  earnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26
  pct and canned pineapples seven pct.
      Products registering high export growth were jewellery up

      In 1986, profits from continuing operations slumped to

  of 30 mln dlrs on discontinued operations.
      Goodrich said Moore is still actively looking for
  acquisitions related to its core areas of business forms
  manufacturing or handling.
      ""We could do a large acquisition,"" he said when asked if
  the company could raise as much as one billion dlrs for this
  purpose.
      Chairman Judson Sinclair, answering a shareholder's
  question, told the annual meeting that a special resolution
  passed by shareholders to create a new class of preferred
  shares would allow Moore to move quickly if it decided to
  pursue an acquisition.
      ""If we were to make a major acquisition ... it means we can

  by the Group of Seven -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France,
  Britain, Italy and Canada -- issued after a Washington meeting
  yesterday.
      1. The finance ministers and central bank governors of
  seven major industrial countries met today.
      They continued the process of multilateral surveillance of
  their economies pursuant to the arrangements for strengthened
  economic policy coordination agreed at the 1986 Tokyo summit of
  their heads of state or government.
      The managing director of the International Monetary Fund
  also participated in the meeting.
      2. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to
  the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting,
  and noted the progress achieved in implementing the
  undertakings embodied in the Louvre Agreement.
      They agreed, however, that further actions will be
  essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain
  global economic expansion, and reduce trade imbalances.
      In this connection they welcomed the proposals just
  announced by the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Japan
  for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate Japan's
  economy through early implementation of a large supplementary
  budget exceeding those of previous years, as well as
  unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.
      The government of Japan reaffirmed its intention to further
  open up its domestic markets to foreign goods and services.
      3. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that
  around current levels their currencies are within ranges
  broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic
  policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.
      In that connection they welcomed the strong implementation
  of the Louvre Agreement.
      They concluded that present and prospective progress in
  implementing the policy undertakings at the Louvre and in this
  statement provided a basis for continuing close cooperation to
  foster the stability of exchange rates.

  Indonesia rejected World Bank
  recommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, as
  the country's foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5
  billion dlrs in grants and soft loans.
      Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarks
  distributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations met
  at The Hague, said, ""The general argument presented by the Bank
  for this free trade, open economy view is weak.""
      The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages the
  largest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agricultural
  growth was stagnating under subsidies for rice farming.
      The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peaked
  and the subsidies are a waste of money.
      Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and provides
  an income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies were
  needed to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,
  exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well as
  assisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.
      Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmers
  should be free to choose their own crops, but he said the
  government would continue to maintain production targets for
  ""strategic commodities"" such as rice and sugar.
      The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia's
  drive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are double
  the world average because of inefficiencies, and the country
  would save money by importing the commodity.
      However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the need
  to save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugar
  industry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.
      He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in the
  agricultural sector were needed to help domestic industry
  develop and because of ""over-production and price intervention
  in the developed nations.""

  U.S. television networks said on
  Monday that U.S. forces launched a retaliatory strike against
  Iran late Sunday, apparently attacking two Iranian offshore oil
  drilling platforms.
      NBC News said it understood six Iranians had been pulled
  from the sea.
      It said cautiously that U.S. forces attacked late Sunday
  and that two Iranian oil platforms east of Bahrain were ablaze
  as a result, but CBS News and other networks said flatly that
  U.S. forces attacked the Iranian oil platforms.
      U.S. officials had been meeting on a response since Friday
  when an attack on a Kuwaiti port severely damaged a
  U.S.-flagged ship.
      President Reagan said on Sunday he had already made a
  decision on the U.S. response to Friday's Iran attack but would
  not say what the decision was.
      Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Saturday the
  attack on a U.S.-flagged ship in Kuwaiti waters on Friday was
  almost certainly by an Iran Silkworm missile.

  The French government's privatisation
  program, which began late last year, has earned the French
  State about 52 billion francs to date, the Finance Ministry
  said.
      Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the
  revenues raised from the privatisation program would be used in
  priority to pay off public debt, which stood at 398.2 billion
  at the end of 1986.
      The Ministry said in a communique that the returns included
  banking group Societe Generale &lt;SGEN.PA>, which began its
  two-week public flotation last Monday.
      The government has carried out eight flotations, as well as
  the private sale of telephone group &lt;Cie Generale de
  Constructions Telephoniques> (CGCT) since its denationalisation
  scheme began last December with the sell-off of glass makers
  Saint-Gobain &lt;SGEP.PA>, it added.
      The government has pledged to privatise 66 state-owned
  industrial, banking and insurance companies by 1991.
      Other companies to be sold to the private sector in the
  near future are television network TF-1 later this month and
  banking group Cie Financiere de Suez &lt;FSPP.PA> in the autumn.
      The ministry said TF-1's forthcoming sell-off meant that a
  third of the government's programme would have been completed
  in less than nine months.
      Balladur on Sunday rejected press and opposition charges
  that the share prices for privatised companies had been pitched
  too low.
      He said that the average premium of shares trading on the
  Bourse was between 15 and 30 pct over their offer price. This
  compared with premiums of between 60 and 80 pct on similar
  share flotations in Britain.

  J Sainsbury Plc&lt;SNB.L> said it agreed to
  take control of the U.S. Shaw's Supermarkets Inc through a
  combination of share purchases and a tender offer at 30 dlrs a
  share.
      Sainsbury bought about 21 pct of the stock in 1983. It said
  its U.S. Subsidiary, Chene Investments Inc, bought 2.55 mln
  common shares from the controlling Davis family yesterday at 30
  dlrs a share for 76.5 mln dlrs, lifting its stake to 49.4 pct.
      A tender offer for the outstanding shares will be launched,
  also at 30 dlrs a share for a maximum further cost of 184.4
  mln.
      The Shaw's Board and the Davis family has agreed to accept
  the offer, thus assuring Sainsbury's a total holding of 74.0
  pct.
      The company had allotted 20.18 mln new ordinary shares to
  &lt;Warburg Securities Ltd> which it said would be sufficient to
  finance about 188 mln dlrs of the maximum 261 mln dlrs payable.
      Shaw's operates a chain of 49 supermarkets in
  Massachusetts, Maine and New Hampshire which in 1986 produced
  sales of 1.1 billiob dlrs and pretax profit of 31.1 mln. At the
  end of 1986 it had net assets of 88 mln dlrs.
      Last September, Sainsbury's increased its stake in Shaw's
  to 28.5 pct. In the year to March 21, it reported a rise in
  pretax profit to 246.9 mln stg from 192.7 mln on sales that
  increased to 4.04 billion from 3.58 billion.
      Sainsbury shares had fallen five pence before the
  announcement to 590p from last night's close but were unmoved
  by news of the deal.

  Japan could avoid a sharp rise in the
  value of the yen against the dollar if Japan, the U.S. And
  other nations succeeded in restructuring their economies, an
  advisory panel to the government's Economic Planning Agency
  (EPA) said.
      The advisory body said in its report that the yen would
  soar against the dollar if structural adjustments on a global
  basis were delayed.
      An EPA official told Reuters the dollar could fall to
  slightly below 100 yen by 1993 if Japan and the U.S. Failed to
  restructure their economies.
      The dollar's fall without structural adjustments would cut
  Japan's current account surplus to two pct of gross national
  product (GNP) in 1993, the report said. It said such a change
  would slow real GNP growth to an average of two pct annually
  during the seven-year period to 1993.
      If the two nations restructured their economies, the dollar
  would remain stable in real terms, while reducing Japan's
  current-account surplus to 2.1 pct of GNP in 1993. This
  scenario put Japan's GNP growth at 3.5 pct a year.
      It forecast real growth of three pct for the world economy
  and four pct for Japan by 2,000 if the adjustments were made.

  The Zambian government has no immediate

  official of the ruling party said.
      Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for
  refined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots in
  which at least 15 people died.
      That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda later
  revoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund
  (IMF) to reduce the government's subsidy bill.
      However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67
  dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price
  increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies,
  a practice discouraged by the IMF.
      ""There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of
  meal. It (the government) would have to choose between the
  demands of the IMF and those of the people,"" a Ministry of

  Paul Volcker's decision not to go for a

  rising inflation, financial market analysts said.

  fighter in the Volcker mould, doubts are already surfacing in
  the U.S. financial markets as to whether he has enough
  political clout and monetary experience to wage a tough

  President Corazon Aquino said the
  Philippines was closely monitoring interest rates in the wake
  of Monday's record drop on Wall Street and steep declines in
  Manila and other Asian stock markets.
      ""We will monitor these developments closely and will
  continue to hope that they do not precipitate large declines in
  economic activity around the world,"" Aquino told a meeting of 13
  major Philippine business groups.
      ""The Philippines, as a trading country in the world economy,
  depends on the continued health and growth of both the world
  economy and the world trading system,"" she said.
      The Manila Stock Exchange composite index plunged 105.49
  points or 11.79 pct by the midday close to 789.54, depressed by
  the record 508 point fall of the Dow Jones industrial average
  on Monday.
      ""The Philippines, in addition, as a large borrower nation,
  is affected by developments in interest rate levels around the
  world and will carefully monitor the impact of these
  developments on interest rates, on gold and on commodity
  prices,"" Aquino said.

test/19539,"BANGLADESH'S TRADE GAP TO WIDEN IN 1987/88
  Bangladesh's trade gap is expected to
  widen in fiscal 1987/88 beginning on July 1 after the
  government relaxed restrictions on some imports including
  luxury cars.
      The country has set its export target for the year at 1.1
  billion U.S. Dlrs against imports of 1.805 billion dlrs,
  compared with 1986/7's one billion dlrs of export earnings and
  1.113 billion dlrs of imports.
      Commerce Minister Mohammad Abdul Munim said the changes
  were aimed at encouraging export oriented industries to boost
  foreign exchange earnings and imports of essential machinery
  and raw materials, to increase industrial production.
      The government was easing procedures to enhance incentives
  especially for exporters of textiles and frozen food and
  importers of industrial machinery and raw materials, Munim told
  reporters.
      Commerce Ministry officials told Reuters the import policy
  covered only commercial imports amounting to 1.805 billion
  dlrs. Imports of capital machinery and foodgrains by the
  government were not included in the policy, they added.
      They said the country's total import bill (both commercial
  and other imports) was expected to reach 2.7 billion dlrs in
  the new year compared with 2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87.
      The minister said ending restrictions on imports of cars
  and dropping 50 pct sales tax on small cars would not harm the
  economy.
      Munim said Bangladesh feared a further drop in prices for
  its main export jute, ""which will certainly affect our export
  earnings"" in the coming year.
      Bangladesh's jute exports fell to 410 mln dlrs from 500 mln
  in 1986/87, according official figures.
      But Munim said exports of non-traditional items, which
  accounted for over 40 pct of total exports this year, would
  play a key role in achieving the 1987/88 export target.

  Residents of central Oklahoma
  returned to their homes over the weekend after a week of heavy

      Some 900 people were evacuated from their homes during the

      Many of the shelters set up throughout the state in areas
  threatened by flooding, except those near the Washita and Red

      Farmers who had expected a near-record wheat crop now say
  this year will see one of the largest losses in decades.
      Gov. Henry Bellmon, who on Thursday declared a flooding
  emergency for central Oklahoma, was expected to ask President
  Reagan for federal disaster relief for the area.
      In northern Texas, officials reported several tornadoes on

  Nippon Steel Corp &lt;NSTC.T> denied local
  newspaper reports that China has been seeking to buy steel
  plants from Japanese firms which plan to suspend output under
  the recently announced rationalisation program.
      The Mainichi Shimbun quoted Nippon Steel as saying that
  China's State Planning Commission and some Chinese firms have
  asked Japanese makers to sell them steel works and rolling
  mills to expand steelmaking cheaply. It named no sources.
      A Nippon Steel spokesman told Reuters that China has made
  no such official request, and the company was not considering
  such sales at the moment.
      But Mainichi quoted Nippon Steel officials as saying if
  prices are reasonable, they would export their used mills to
  China.
      The paper said China's crude steel output totalled 52 mln
  tonnes in calendar 1986 and that it plans to increase to 80 mln
  by 1996.
      Japan's steel industry rationalisation plan is aimed at
  cutting production capacity sharply over the next few years.

  International Business Machines
  Corp said shipments and revenues were higher in the first

      IBM said net income fell to 785 mln dlrs or 1.30 dlrs a
  share from 1.02 billion dlrs or 1.65 dlrs on about 1.8 pct
  fewer shares outstanding.
      While total sales and income rose 5.5 pct to 10.68 billion

  to 9.61 billion dlrs from 8.57 billion in the quarter, the

      The company said it continues to take actions to make it
  more competitive, including cost and expense reduction
  measures.
      ""Although the worldwide economic situation remains
  unsettled, there are some encouraging signs in our business,""
  IBM said in a statement.
      ""In addition to the increase in first quarter shipments, we
  have announced new offerings in our large processor and

      ""We have yet to fully benefit from our recent product
  announcements, retirement incentives and other resource

  The Bundesbank accepted bids for 6.1
  billion marks at today's tender for a 28-day securities
  repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct, a central bank
  spokesman said.
      Banks, which bid for a total 12.2 billion marks liquidity,
  will be credited with the funds allocated today and must buy
  back securities pledged on May 6.
      Some 14.9 billion marks will drain from the market today as
  an earlier pact expires, so the Bundesbank is effectively
  withdrawing a net 8.1 billion marks from the market with
  today's allocation.
      A Bundesbank spokesman said in answer to enquiries that the
  withdrawal of funds did not reflect a tightening of credit
  policy, but was to be seen in the context of plentiful
  liquidity in the banking system.
      Banks held an average 59.3 billion marks at the Bundesbank
  over the first six days of the month, well clear of the likely
  April minimum reserve requirement of 51 billion marks.
      The Bundesbank spokesman noted that by bidding only 12.2
  billion marks, below the outgoing 14.9 billion, banks
  themselves had shown they felt they had plenty of liquidity.
      Dealers said the Bundesbank is keen to prevent too much
  liquidity accruing in the market, as that would blunt the
  effectiveness of the security repurchase agreement, its main
  open-market instrument for steering market interest rates. Two
  further pacts are likely this month over the next two weeks.
      The Bundesbank is currently steering call money between 3.6
  and 3.8 pct, although short-term fluctuations outside that
  range are possible, dealers said.

  plans no bid of its own for debt-troubled Dome.
      ""We've no plan to bid,"" Blair told reporters after a speech

  TransCanada and was considering a proposal from another company
  and was also talking with another possible buyer, both rumored
  to be offshore.
      Asked by reporters if Dome should remain in Canadian hands,
  Blair replied, ""Yes. I think that we still need to be building
  as much Canadian position in this industry as we can and I
  think it would be best if Dome ends up in the hands of Canadian
  management.""
      He said he did not know who other possible bidders were.
      Blair said that any move to put Dome's financial house in

  have hung over Western Canadian industry.""
      He added, however, that the energy industry still faced ""a

test/15364,"BUNDESBANK CALLS FOR CENTRAL BANK COOPERATION
  Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler
  called on central banks of major industrialised nations to
  cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies.
      In a lecture at the University of Surrey, pre-released
  here, Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was
  protectionism and control on capital movements.
      ""Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market
  transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have
  them,"" he said. He added that West German growth forecasts would
  have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop
  to 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.
      Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets
  had parted company with transactions in goods, services and
  investments. It was the scale of speculative transactions that
  determined market trends.
      Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to
  grow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates
  would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.
      ""In other words, the monetary policy measures required are
  different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to --
  those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of
  mounting economic activity,"" Koehler said.
      The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S.
  Current account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciation
  going by talking the dollar down posed problems.
      The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep
  rise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the cost
  of European imports. But the volume effect of falling imports
  to the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time to
  make itself felt compared with the price effect.
      ""Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going
  further than would be necessary to adjust the current account
  over the medium term,"" Koehler said.
      A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occur
  only if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand.
  In Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand should
  rise faster than GNP.
      ""In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986,"" Koehler said.
      If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be
  prevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset by
  an inflow of foreign funds into the U.S..
      But only if there was an appropriate interest rate
  differential would Europe and Japan look for financial
  investment in the U.S.
      When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank
  had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its
  measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.
      Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates
  by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading
  interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market
  and its substantial impact on exchange rates.
      It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of
  price stability, economic growth and full employment but also
  to tackle international problems like the exchange rate
  problem, the debt problem and the current account problem.
      A strategy had to be designed that helped ""the safeguarding
  of non-inflationary economic growth in an international
  monetary system largely free of disruptions,"" Koehler said.
      Given the system of floating exchange rates, it was
  necessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficed
  to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over
  the next few years and intervention points should not be set,
  because they were only testing points for the market, he said.
      In order to keep the international monetary system free of
  disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but
  also cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said.

      In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also acknowledged he was

test/20461,"ASA SAYS EC OILSEED POLICY ILLEGAL UNDER GATT
  The American Soybean Association (ASA)
  denounced European Community (EC) oilseed policies as illegal
  under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and
  threatened to make an unfair trade complaint if the EC does not
  remedy the situation.
      ASA Vice President James Adams told an ASA-sponsored
  Outlook 87 conference: ""It will be filed unless the EC takes
  drastic and immediate steps.""
      ""These subsidies are blatantly unfair and are GATT illegal,
  since they were established after the zero soybean duty was
  established in 1962,"" he said.
      The ASA's unfair trade petition against the EC would ask
  for an investigation and modification of EC oilseed policies to
  make the regime non-discriminatory.
      The EC in 1962 ruled all EC oilseed imports duty-free, in
  an effort to fill its oilseed needs. But EC oilseeds production
  has risen dramatically since then.
      The EC now guarantees oilseed prices to farmers above world
  market levels and is considering implementing a controversial
  oils and fats tax.
      The subsidies ""are obvious attempts to circumvent the zero
  duty binding and that makes U.S. Farmers mad as hell,"" Adams
  said.
      The ASA is confident the U.S. Congress will support its
  trade complaint, Adams said. The ASA also strongly opposes an
  EC proposal to tax vegetable and marine oils consumed in the
  EC, which will be considered by the EC Commission in December.
      U.S. Soybean world market share has declined 35 pct in
  volume and 40 pct in value since 1982, primarily as a result of
  EC policies, Adams added.
      Lord Plumb, European Parliament President and a speaker at
  the conference, said the EC expanded oilseed production in 1973
  when the U.S. Halted overseas sales of soy products.

test/15460,"EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE
  European currency markets reacted quietly
  to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers
  ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to
  surprise that the markets should have expected so much.
      The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies
  and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which
  reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency
  stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.
      Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining
  broadly entrenched in its current trading range.
      ""The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84
  marks,"" said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank
  AG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.
      However, she said the dollar could break out of the range
  with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.
  Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.
      Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd
  in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against
  the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,
  possibly to 140 yen.
      A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects
  a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.
      London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb
  underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative
  sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank
  operators to test the downside.
      Concern that finance ministers and officials still in
  Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of
  currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with
  worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the
  long term, the traders said.
      Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the
  communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's
  downward trend.
      Traders in several centres said the market would look for
  fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to
  defend current ranges, which the communique said were ""broadly
  consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy
  intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.""
      Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said
  ""They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon."" The
  U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.
      However, some dealers said London-based operators would be
  unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long
  Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825
  marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.
      Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said
  the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable
  market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme
  volatility seen in the first few months of this year.
      One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the
  communique made clear the leading nations did not want a
  further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.
      The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to
  1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre
  accord's supposed currency target range.
      A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were
  ready for a period of ""mainly sideways movement.""
      But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique
  contributing to greater stability.
      ""Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big
  boost,"" said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he
  expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks
  in the next three months.

test/19760,"SEC SAYS CAMPEAU UNIT VIOLATED DISCLOSURE RULES
  The Securities and Exchange
  Commission charged Allied Stores Corp with failing to promptly
  disclose key steps it was taking last September to thwart a
  takeover attempt by Campeau Corp.
      In an administrative complaint, the SEC said Allied and its
  legal adviser failed to promptly inform shareholders and the
  agency that it had begun talks with Youngstown, Ohio, shopping
  center developer Edward DeBartolo in response to Campeau's
  takeover offer.
      Campeau acquired Allied for an estimated 4.2 billion dlrs
  on Jan 1, following a battle with DeBartolo.
      On Sept 25, a day after Allied disclosed that its board had
  urged rejection of Campeau's Sept 12 tender offer for 58 dlrs a
  share, Allied began negotiating the sale of six shopping
  centers to DeBartolo, the SEC said.
      Allied legal advisor and director George Kern, who heads
  the merger and acquisitions group at the New York law firm of
  Sullivan and Cromwell, decided against amending Allied's SEC
  filing to disclose the talks even though they had resulted in
  sales price of 405 mln dlrs for the shopping centers, it said.
      Securities law requires takeover target companies to
  promptly disclose such things as the sale of major assets.
      The day after Campeau increased its tender offer to 80 pct
  of Allied's stock from 55 pct and raised its bid to 66 dlrs a
  share from 58 dlrs on Sept 29, Allied and a partnership headed
  by DeBartolo began negotiating a takeover deal aimed at
  thwarting Campeau, the SEC said.
      Kern again decided against disclosing the talks in an
  amended SEC filing, the agency charged.
      Allied's first disclosure of the DeBartolo takeover was
  made on Oct 8, even though its board approved the merger on Oct
  3 and the merger agreement was executed on Oct 7, the complaint
  said.
      DeBartolo and Campeau later engaged in a bitter battle for
  control of Allied, with Campeau winning out later in October
  when it bought a block of 25.8 mln shares of Allied stock, or
  48 pct of the total, in a controversial move made only minutes
  after it dropped its hostile tender offer.
      The acquisition of the additional 48 pct, which a federal
  judge allowed to be completed, gave Campeau a majority stake in
  Allied. Campeau bought the rest at 69 dlrs a share.
      The SEC said it had planned to file a court brief joining
  with Allied in charging that Campeau had engaged in an illegal
  tender offer.
      But the SEC brief was never filed since the case was
  dropped following an agreement between Campeau and DeBartolo.
      In the administrative proceeding against Allied and Kern,
  the SEC is asking for an administrative order that they comply
  with reporting provisions of securities laws in the future.
      Although Allied is no longer publicly traded since it
  became a subsidiary of Campeau, it still files annual and
  quarterly reports to the SEC because it has outstanding debt.

test/19964,"U.S./SOVIET GRAIN MEETING UNLIKELY THIS SUMMER
  Prospects appear slim for a summer
  meeting between U.S. and Soviet officials before the two
  countries enter the final year of their bilateral grains
  agreement, Agriculture Department officials said.
      The two sides usually try to meet as each new year of the
  agreeement approaches although the last meeting was delayed up
  to last February. However, any delay this year should not
  endanger the fifth year of the grains agreement that extends
  through September, 1988, USDA officials said.
      ""It will be difficult to pull together the people for the
  meeting during July,"" an aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel
  Amstutz said.
      Since the last meeting was only around four months ago, the
  next talks could still be a ""couple more months,"" he said.
     
      There has been grain industry speculation that the USDA
  will offer Moscow another wheat subsidy during the next
  marketing year. But USDA officials said even if consultations
  were held soon a subsidy offer would probably not be made.
      ""I doubt that there would be any subsidy offer this summer
  or before the next agreement year begins,"" a USDA source said.
      Citing limited subsidy funds and uncertainties about next
  year's crops, he said, ""There are too many variables now. It
  would be uncharacteristic of us to make an offer now.""
      Under the nonbinding pact, Moscow has agreed to purchase a
  minimum of nine mln tonnes of U.S. grain per year. Soviet and
  U.S. officials normally meet in the summer before the start of
  a new agreement year to discuss grain quality, shipping
  logistics and production outlooks.

test/21002,"HUGE OIL PLATFORMS DOT GULF LIKE BEACONS
  Huge oil platforms dot the Gulf like
  beacons -- usually lit up like Christmas trees at night.
      One of them, sitting astride the Rostam offshore oilfield,
  was all but blown out of the water by U.S. Warships on Monday.
      The Iranian platform, an unsightly mass of steel and
  concrete, was a three-tier structure rising 200 feet (60
  metres) above the warm waters of the Gulf until four U.S.
  Destroyers pumped some 1,000 shells into it.
      The U.S. Defense Department said just 10 pct of one section
  of the structure remained.
      U.S. helicopters destroyed three Iranian gunboats after an
  American helicopter came under fire earlier this month and U.S.
  forces attacked, seized, and sank an Iranian ship they said had
  been caught laying mines.
      But Iran was not deterred, according to U.S. defense
  officials, who said Iranian forces used Chinese-made Silkworm
  missiles to hit a U.S.-owned Liberian-flagged ship on Thursday
  and the Sea Isle City on Friday.
      Both ships were hit in the territorial waters of Kuwait, a
  key backer of Iraq in its war with Iran.
      Henry Schuler, a former U.S. diplomat in the Middle East
  now with CSIS said Washington had agreed to escort Kuwaiti
  tankers in order to deter Iranian attacks on shipping.
      But he said the deterrence policy had failed and the level
  of violence and threats to shipping had increased as a result
  of U.S. intervention and Iran's response.
      The attack on the oil platform was the latest example of a
  U.S. ""tit-for-tat"" policy that gave Iran the initiative, said
  Harlan Ullman, an ex-career naval officer now with CSIS.
      He said with this appraoch America would suffer ""the death
  of one thousand cuts.""
      But for the United States to grab the initiative
  militarily, it must take warlike steps such as mining Iran's
  harbors or blockading the mouth of the Gulf through which its
  shipping must pass, Schuler said.
      He was among those advocating mining as a means of bringing
  Iran to the neogtiating table. If vital supplies were cut off,
  Tehran could not continue the war with Iraq.
      Ullman said Washington should join Moscow in a diplomatic
  initiative to end the war and the superpowers should impose an
  arms embargo against Tehran if it refused to negotiate.
      He said the United States should also threaten to mine and
  blockade Iran if it continued fighting and must press Iraq to
  acknowledge responsibility for starting the war as part of a
  settlement.
      Iranian and Western diplomats say Iraq started the war by
  invading Iran's territory in 1980. Iraq blames Iran for the
  outbreak of hostilities, which have entailed World War I-style
  infantry attacks resulting in horrific casualties.
      Each side has attacked the others' shipping.

      Agrimont SPA, the holding company for Montedison's
  Agro-Industrial businesses, had sales of 810 billion lire and a
  net profit of about 1.1 billion lire, after amortization costs
  of 35 billion lire and a 13 billion lire reduction in the value

      Agrimont, still wholly owned by Montedison, is taking steps
  to be traded on the Milan exchange, the company said.
      The company said that 1986 was characterized by an unstable
  fertlizer market due to the weak dollar and the decline of
  international prices for products sold in Europe and the U.S
  where Agrimont operates through its Conserv division.
      In pesticides and in animal health care products Agrimont
  maintained its previous level of revenues and market share in
  1986, Montedison said.
      Montedison said it named Ettore dell'Isola to the newly

      Montedison also said it named Renato Picco, managing

  British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey
  Howe backed the United States' attack on an Iranian oil

  crisis.
      ""The United States is fully entitled to take military action
  in exercise of rights of self-defense, in the face of the
  imminent threat of further attacks,"" Howe said in a statement
  issued in London.
      The United States said its forces destroyed the platform on
  Monday in retaliation for an Iranian missile attack on a U.S.-
  flagged Kuwaiti ship last Friday.
      Referring to that attack, Howe added, ""I trust the Iranians
  will fully understand that continued attacks of this kind will
  only enhance justification for firm action in self-defense.""
      At a press conferenced in Luxembourg during a meeting of
  European Community (EC) ministers, Howe was asked about
  statements from a senior Iranian official who said America was
  now involved in a full-scale war.
      ""It would be profoundly undesirable and quite unjustified

  Chrysler Corp and Regie Natiionale des
  Usines Renault said they agreed to extend by up to two weeks
  the period for reaching definitive agreement on Chrysler's
  proposed 1.5 billion dlr takeover of American Motors Corp.
      The letter of intent signed by Chrysler and Renault on
  March nine set April nine as the target date for completing
  negotiations.
      However, the letter also allowed room for an extension of
  that date to April 23 if an agreement could not be reached.
      The two companies said they ""now plan to complete work by
  April 23.""
      Chrysler and Renault said, ""Given the complex nature of the
  deal, the need for additional time was to be expected.""
      The March letter of intent between the two companies says
  that Chrysler could ask Renault to extend the agreement date
  ""in the event that prior to April 9, 1987, Chrysler discovers
  an unforeseen problem in the course of its 'due diligence'
  investigation of the company,"" referring to American Motors.
      A Chrysler spokeswoman would not say whether some problem
  had cropped up in the talks. She stuck by the company's
  statement that more time was needed because the talks are
  complex. ""That is our definition of the delay,"" she said.
      Under the previous agreement between Chrysler and Renault,
  their letter of intent would be terminated on April nine or
  when an agreement was reached. But the letter could be amendend
  by a written agreement by both companies.
      The Chrysler spokeswoman said, ""We are still working toward
  a definitive agreement."" Said another Chrysler official who is
  not part of the talks but who would be told if the deal were in
  trouble: ""There are no glitches.""
      Analysts also downplayed the significance of the delay. ""I
  can't visualize where they wouldn't want it to be done,"" said
  Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette analyst Richard Henderson.

  Medtronic Inc said it sees 15 pct
  growth in sales and earnings for the year ending April 30,
  1988.
      At an analysts meeting here the company said that for the
  year ending April 30, 1987 it will earn about 73 mln dlrs, or
  about 5.15-5.35 dlrs a share on sales of about 500 mln dlrs.
      In the year ago period, the company earned 53.4 mln dlrs,
  or 3.65 dlrs a share, on sales of 402.8 mln dlrs.
      Winston Wallin, Medtronic chairman, said the company will
  improve market share in fiscal 1988 in cardiac pacemakers and
  expand its cardiovascular therapeutic product line.
      Wallin cautioned analysts not to quickly change their per
  share estimates for the company as he said Medtronic will have
  heavy sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 1988.
      He said the company intends to reinvest its earnings in its
  businesses and not in its dividends. ""Shareholders are better
  off if we grow the business rather than reinvest in dividends
  or share repurchases,"" he said.
      Wallin said he sees Medtronic's share of the total
  worldwide pacemaker market increasing to 42 pct in fiscal 1988,
  from 40 pct in fiscal 1987.
      He said the worldwide market for cardiovascualr therapeutic
  products, which includes pacemakers, valves, catheters and
  lasers, will be valued at about 2.5 billion dlrs 1990 and will
  double that by 1995.
      Wallin said, ""Our objective is to get a hold of new
  products and start building market share if we have to beg,
  borrow or steal to get into new markets.""
      In the past, Medtronic's pacemakers have been plagued with
  a number of problems leading to product recalls. Regulators
  also have criticized the industry, citing quality problems and
  a needless overprescription of pacemakers.
      ""We have no knowledge of any major problems in our
  pacemakers or leads,"" Wallin said. ""We intend to re-establish
  our company as the quality leader in the industry.""
      Glen Nelson, executive vice president for Medtronics, said
  the company intends to diversify internally and through
  acquisitions of companies in areas of Medtronic's expertise,
  such as drug delivery systems.
      Wallin said the 15 pct earnings growth for fiscal 1988 does
  not include dilutions from acquisitions. ""We hope to have some
  safety provisions so that we won't have any major dilutions
  from an acquisition.""
      Wallin also said the company will have virtual exclusivity
  in rate responsive pacemakers for all of fiscal 1988.
      The company markets Activitrax, the first single chamber
  pacemaker that varies heartrate in response to physical
  activity.
      Siemens AG, a West German company, is also developing a
  rate responsive pacemaker.

  The Soviet trade deficit with the West
  almost quadrupled last year, reaching 2.72 billion roubles
  compared with 713 mln in 1985, official figures showed.
      Statistics published by the monthly journal Foreign Trade
  showed Soviet trade turnover for 1986 fell to 130.9 billion
  roubles from 142.1 billion the previous year, a drop of 7.8
  pct.
      Moscow's trade surplus with East Bloc countries continued
  to grow in 1986.
      Western analysts attributed the deficit rise with the West
  to the world oil price slump, which hit Moscow's main export
  and cut hard currency earnings needed for purchases in the
  West.

  National Bank economic data for 1986
  shows that Yugoslavia's trade deficit grew, the inflation rate
  rose, wages were sharply higher, the money supply expanded and
  the value of the dinar fell.
      The trade deficit for 1986 was 2.012 billion dlrs, 25.7 pct
  higher than in 1985. The trend continued in the first three
  months of this year as exports dropped by 17.8 pct, in hard
  currency terms, to 2.124 billion dlrs.
      Yugoslavia this year started quoting trade figures in
  dinars based on current exchange rates, instead of dollars
  based on a fixed exchange rate of 264.53 dinars per dollar.
      Yugoslavia's balance of payments surplus with the
  convertible currency area fell to 245 mln dlrs in 1986 from 344
  mln in 1985. The National Bank said the drop was due to a
  deterioration in trade. Exports to the convertible currency
  area rose 11.6 pct from 1985, while imports rose 17.8 pct.
      Retail prices rose an average of 88.1 pct in 1986 while
  industrial producer prices rose by 70.6 pct, the bank's data
  showed. The cost of living rose by 89.1 pct.
      Personal incomes rose by 109 pct in 1986.
      Prime Minister Branko Mikulic warned in February that wages
  were too high given the level of productivity.
      Mikulic introduced a law cutting wages to the level of the
  last quarter of 1986 and tying future rises to productivity.
      Bank statistics show the overall 1986 rise in M-1 money
  supply was 109.1 pct with a year-end position of 3,895.9
  billion dinars. Yugoslavs have 9.8 billion dlrs worth of
  foreign currency savings in the country and 20 billion dlrs
  abroad, mostly owned by workers employed in western Europe.
      The dinar fell by 73.1 pct against a basket of hard
  currencies in 1986. The highest depreciation was against the
  Swiss franc, 85.3 pct, and the lowest against the U.S. Dollar,
  46.2 pct.

  Secretary of State George Shultz said

  partners might be traumatic.
      ""The U.S. Economy will inevitably make the adjustment
  necessary to move from a deficit to a surplus trade balance in
  order to service our growing foreign debt,"" he told a conference
  attended by the six members of the Association of Southeast
  Asian Nations and their leading Western friends.
      ""In my view, this will happen more rapidly than many
  observers now predict.""
      ""The universal strategy of aggressive export-led growth is
  becoming less effective,"" Shultz said.
      ""It is not arithmetically possible for every country in the
  world to be a net exporter at the same time. The U.S. Deficit,
  which we all decry, has been in a sense the place into which
  everyone's export-led strategy for growth has gone.""
      ""The huge surpluses of Japan and (West) Germany have fed on
  this deficit, so something will have to give and it will be
  possibly a traumatic experience,"" he added.
      ""While you must keep up the pressure on us to eschew
  protectionist policies, you must act too,"" Shultz said.
      ""I can do a better job of convincing the Congress to leave
  our door open to imports if more of our trading partners open
  their doors wider,"" he told the group, which included

test/15106,"BRAZIL GRAIN HARVEST FACES STORAGE PROBLEMS
  Storage problems with Brazil's record
  grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln
  tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said.
      Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia,
  told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this
  year's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.
      He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in
  harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage
  problems.
      Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes,
  theoretically sufficient for the crop.
      But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly
  distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do
  Sul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but were
  responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.
      The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West
  growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage
  capacity.
      Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and
  maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grains
  production but only 20 pct of its storage space.
      In addition to the poor distribution of storage units,
  there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to
  storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for
  storing loose grain, Brito said.
      Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the
  crops.
      The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop
  has been evident from television reports, which have shown
  enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.

  Dwindling global crude oil reserves and
  the lack of any major new discoveries in recent years will send
  the world into an energy crisis by 1990, the former Atlantic
  Richfield Co chairman Robert O. Anderson said.
      ""It's going to come sooner than anyone thinks,"" Anderson
  told reporters after addressing a Houston business lunch. ""I
  believe we're going to see a change in the world oil markets in
  two to three years because oil is becoming harder to find.""
      Anderson, who retired from Arco last year to form Hondo Oil
  and Gas Co, said world oil consumption is approaching 60 mln
  barrels a day but a current excess capacity cushion of about
  4.5 mln barrels a day will rapidly disappear.
      ""If you looked around the world, you could not scrape up
  one mln barrels a day in shut-in production outside the Middle
  East,"" he said. ""We're soon going to be right back where we
  were in 1973 and 1979.""
      Anderson predicted that world oil prices would end 1987 at
  about 24 dlrs a barrel and continue a gradual climb.
      ""There's no way prices can stay flat because there isn't
  enough supply,"" he said. ""There have been no major oil
  discoveries for the past 15 to 20 years.""

test/20500,"BAKER SEEN WINNING GERMAN INTEREST RATES BATTLE
  The United States appears to have won a
  transatlantic battle by forcing the Bundesbank to trim interest
  rates, European economists said.
      But they added Washington set the stakes high by testing
  the limits of the Louvre accord while global stock markets were
  plunging.
      West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.
  Treasury Secretary James Baker reaffirmed their commitment to
  currency stability at a secret meeting yesterday in Frankfurt,
  according to official statements released late Monday.
      Only 13 hours after the statements were released, the
  Bundesbank reduced short-term interest rates by offering banks
  liquidity at a fixed bid rate of 3.80 pct, down from a 3.85 pct
  facility rate offered last week.
      While the two ministers were meeting with Bundesbank
  president Karl Otto Poehl, the central bank had also added
  money market liquidity repeatedly, signalling it did not want a
  strong rise in the tender allocation rate on Tuesday.
       ""It's round one to the Americans, "" said Richard Reid,
  senior European economist for brokers UBS/Philips and Drew in
  London.
      But Reid added, ""We shouldn't forget that it has taken one
  of the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the West
  Germans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 0.05
  percentage point.""
      Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of earlier tightening
  of West German monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall and
  fuelled speculation that the Louvre accord was no longer valid.
      Six leading industrial nations agreed under February's
  Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetary
  policies. It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven -
  the US, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
      The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency markets
  and the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours trading
  in New York. At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday, the dollar was
  quoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on Monday.
      Guenther Aschoff, chief economist at Deutsche
  Genossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on world
  stock markets had been the main reason for the fall in West
  German short-term interest rates on Tuesday.
      ""The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock market
  losses... That was the responsible thing to do and if it fits
  with Baker's wishes, then all the better,"" he said.
      No central bank wants to let interest rates rise, and the
  Bundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following rises
  in the U.S., Aschoff said.
      Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the central
  bank has no interest in higher capital market rates and he
  thought the global rate increase was a cause for concern.
      Giles Keating, economist with Credit Suisse First Boston
  Ltd in London said ""The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreat
  and Baker has won a battle...But he hasn't won the war as the
  security repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it was
  before the IMF meeting last month in Washington.""
      Before the IMF meeting, when the Louvre Accord was
  reaffirmed, the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidity
  at 3.60 pct, Keating noted.
      Economists said the United States now appeared to have
  agreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and support
  the dollar in return for the German action on interest rates.
      Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinder
  Washington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit, Stoltenberg
  told a news conference on Tuesday. He added he would not rule
  out central banks of leading industrial countries intervening
  on exchange markets to defend the dollar's value.
      Deutsche Genossenschaftbank's Aschoff stressed West
  Germany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currency
  stability. In addition, both the U.S. And West German central
  banks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force them
  to again spend vast sums intervening to support the dollar.

test/14826,"ASIAN EXPORTERS FEAR DAMAGE FROM U.S.-JAPAN RIFT
  Mounting trade friction between the
  U.S. And Japan has raised fears among many of Asia's exporting
  nations that the row could inflict far-reaching economic
  damage, businessmen and officials said.
      They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S.
  Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the
  U.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products.
      But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurt
  them in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo's loss might be
  their gain.
      The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on
  imports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, in
  retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to stick to a pact not
  to sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost.
      Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs
  at 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms
  said they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the
  new taxes.
      ""We wouldn't be able to do business,"" said a spokesman for
  leading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita Electric
  Industrial Co Ltd &lt;MC.T>.
      ""If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time
  beyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion of
  exports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the U.S.,"" said Tom
  Murtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker &lt;James
  Capel and Co>.
      In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried.
      ""We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S. Threat against
  Japan because it serves as a warning to us,"" said a senior
  Taiwanese trade official who asked not to be named.
      Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs last
  year, 95 pct of it with the U.S.
      The surplus helped swell Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves
  to 53 billion dlrs, among the world's largest.
      ""We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers and
  cut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if we
  want to defuse problems from possible U.S. Retaliation,"" said
  Paul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters &lt;Taiwan Safe Group>.
      A senior official of South Korea's trade promotion
  association said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japan
  might also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exports
  are similar to those of Japan.
      Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billion
  dlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.
      In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said tough
  curbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers of
  semiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the
  U.S.
      In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has been
  selling below-cost semiconductors, some electronics
  manufacturers share that view. But other businessmen said such
  a short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by
  further U.S. Pressure to block imports.
      ""That is a very short-term view,"" said Lawrence Mills,
  director-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry.
      ""If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it will
  be extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kong
  is the disadvantage of action restraining trade,"" he said.
      The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong's biggest export market,
  accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports.
      The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade
  talks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern,
  Industry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday.
      ""This kind of deterioration in trade relations between two
  countries which are major trading partners of ours is a very
  serious matter,"" Button said.
      He said Australia's concerns centred on coal and beef,
  Australia's two largest exports to Japan and also significant
  U.S. Exports to that country.
      Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve the
  trade stand-off continue.
      Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlined
  a package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy.
      The measures proposed include a large supplementary budget
  and record public works spending in the first half of the
  financial year.
      They also call for stepped-up spending as an emergency
  measure to stimulate the economy despite Prime Minister
  Yasuhiro Nakasone's avowed fiscal reform program.
      Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and Makoto
  Kuroda, Japan's deputy minister of International Trade and
  Industry (MITI), are due to meet in Washington this week in an
  effort to end the dispute.

  Based on field travel in the
  Brazilian state of Parana, soybean yields should be about
  average or 2.0 to 2.2 tonnes per hectare, the U.S. Agriculture
  Department's officer in Sao Paulo said in a field report.
      The report, dated March 24, noted Parana accounts for about
  20 to 24 pct of Brazil's total soybean crop.
      It said generally favorable weather from early December
  through February helped compensate for earlier dryness.
      However, hot, dry weather during the past 20 to 30 days
  followed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the second
  week of march has raised concern about late planted soybeans
  which are still immature, but the impact may be localized, the
  report said.
      The corn crop is expected to be a record and will create
  serious storage problems, the report said.
      Due to favorable support prices, corn area increased by
  more than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans, and yields are
  expected to be above average, it said.
      Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn crop
  crop has been harvested.
      During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grain
  elevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn, the
  report said.
      New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline  -- Parana
  accounts for about 60 pct of total production. Major reasons
  for the decline are expected reduced government support price
  and good summer crop harvests.

test/19497,"OIL MARKETS SHOW RESPECT FOR NEW OPEC ACCORD
  OPEC has shown itself to be in control
  of the world oil situation with its speed in hammering out a
  pact to limit crude oil output to 16.6 mln barrels per day
  (bpd) for the rest of 1987, oil traders said.
      They said market respect for the cartel has increased since
  it announced Saturday that it would cut fourth quarter output
  to 16.6 mln bpd from the 18.3 mln agreed in December.
      ""There are light oversupplies now, but OPEC ... Has ensured
  there will be no oversupplies in the fourth quarter, and is in
  effect putting pressure on end-users,"" a European crude oil
  trader said.
      In Tokyo, one oil analyst said, ""There's no reason to expect
  a weak market from now on.""
      A Japanese oil trader, also based in Tokyo, said, ""We
  thought OPEC would have difficulty agreeing on fourth quarter
  production so the market will react very bullishly.""
      Traders in Singapore said that while there has been only a
  slight increase so far in spot quotes for Dubai, a benchmark
  crude, they expect price increases over the next few days.
      August Dubai was discussed in cautious early activity at
  around 17.35 dlrs, above Friday's 17.15-20 range, but still
  below the government selling price (GSP) of 17.42.
      Even prices of light Mideast grades, such as Qatar and Abu
  Dhabi crudes, are expected to improve from recent weak
  positions, 15 to 20 cents below their GSP's. Singapore traders
  said sellers might now aim for GSP's at least.
      They said that after initial jumps, they expect prices to
  stabilise and hover around GSPs for the next few months.
      They said the Japanese oil market would be most affected
  and Japanese end-users would need to rebuild stocks for winter
  requirements before October.
      Prices are most likely to rise in the fourth quarter on
  European and U.S. Stockbuilding for winter, they added.
      ""There's no doubt consumption will be higher than production
  by the fourth quarter and stocks are not that high,"" said an
  international trader in Tokyo. Another Tokyo trader was less
  bullish, ""For sure there will be some shortage but it depends on
  how much they (OPEC members) cheat.""
      A Singapore trade source said, ""There is enough cheating and
  leakage in the OPEC sales system to convince traders there is
  no need to worry about shortages.""
      Other traders said the questionable Iraqi production level,
  after Iraq's rejection of its assigned quota, was a bearish
  factor to be considered.
      Traders also said end-users now would buy as much as
  possible on term contracts and buy spot only when the market
  cooled from its initial reaction to the OPEC agreement.
      Spot product prices in Singapore were little changed in
  thin early discussions, with naphtha and middle distillates
  quiet on minimal buying interest.
      Fuel oil products were steady to firm on light demand and
  tight prompt supplies, dealers said.

test/16367,"CHEMICAL &lt;CHL> NET HURT BY BRAZIL, EXPENSES
  Chemical New York Corp said its
  first-quarter profits fell by 16 pct, largely because it placed
  1.04 billion dlrs of loans to Brazil on non-accrual.
      Chemical reported first-quarter net income of 86.2 mln
  dlrs, down from 102.6 mln a year earlier, but declaring the
  Brazilian loans non-performing cost Chemical 21 mln dlrs in
  lost interest income, or 12 mln dlrs after-tax.
      A 13.3 pct jump in non-interest expense to 471.3 mln dlrs
  from 415.9 mln also hit the bottom line. It said the rise was
  mainly due to staff costs associated with continued growth in
  consumer, capital markets and investment banking activities.
      Excluding the effect of placing Brazil on non-accrual,
  Chemical said its net income would have been 98.2 mln dlrs, or
  4.3 pct below 1986 earnings.
      Brazil suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of
  medium- and long-term debt on February 20. If they are not
  resumed by year's end, Chemical said its after-tax net for the
  whole of 1987 will be reduced by about 51 mln dlrs.
      Chemical also placed 52 mln dlrs of loans to Ecuador on
  non-accrual because the Quito government also suspended
  interest payments on its foreign debt. This reduced interest
  income by 1.5 mln dlrs.
      Chemical said net interest income fell to 476.4 mln dlrs
  from 488.9 mln and its net spread narrowed to 3.61 pct from
  3.96 pct.
      This reflected the reclassification of Brazilian loans, a
  reduced federal income tax rate (which affected the calculation
  of the taxabale-equivalent adjustment on tax-exempt assets) and
  a narrowing of the spread between the prime rate and Chemical's
  cost of funds.
      Foreign exchange trading profits rose to 37.9 mln dlrs from
  27.0 mln, but bond trading profits dropped to 21.9 mln dlrs
  from 26.2 mln.
      Fees from trust and other banking services rose to 146.5
  mln dlrs from 129.3 mln a year earlier, Chemical said.
      The provision for loan losses was 87.2 mln dlrs, compared
  with 83.8 mln. Net loan charge-offs were 86.5 mln, up from 60.7
  mln, leaving the allowance for loan losses at 672.6 mln dlrs at
  quarter's end, or 1.74 pct of loans outstanding, compared with
  594.3 mln, or 1.50 pct, a year earlier.
      Non-accruing loans at the end of March were 2.39 billion
  dlrs (1.35 billion excluding Brazil), compared with 1.35
  billion at the end of 1986 and 1.22 billion at the end of
  March, 1986.

test/15239,"UAL &lt;UAL> MAY RESPOND TO PILOTS TODAY
  UAL Inc may have a response this
  afternoon to the pilots union proposal to buy its United
  Airlines unit, a UAL spokesman said.
      ""Obviously, we have a lot of movement in our stock, and we
  need to get a clarification out,"" the spokesman said, adding
  that there was a ""50-50"" chance a statement would be released
  today.
      The pilots earlier this week offered to buy the airline for
  2.3 billion dlrs, and assume 2.2 billion dlrs of existing debt.
      Takeover speculation has driven UAL's stock for several
  weeks. UAL last month said New York Real estate developer
  Donald Trump held a position in its stock, and that he also
  held discussions with its chairman.
      The developer indicated in those talks that he took the
  position as an investment, but he revealed no other plans.
      Today, rumors circulated that Coniston Partners were buying
  UAL stock. UAL jumped five to 70-3/4 on volume of more than 3.2
  mln shares.
      ""United has got to consider this proposal. I think the
  pilot's proposal is realistic. I don't exptect them to take it,
  but it could put some interesting options in front of UAL
  management,"" said Timothy Pettee, Bear Stearns and co analyst.
      Analysts have said UAL made itself vulnerable to attack
  when it diversified away from its core airline. It added Hertz
  rental cars, Westin and Hilton International hotels in a
  strategy to become a travel service company.
      The strategy left its stock in a slump and its pilots union
  concerned that the company was not focussing enough attention
  on its airline.
      UAL has stood firm on its strategy. It is emphasizing its
  new focus by changing its name to Allegis, as of May one.
      But takeover speculation has escalated, and Wall Street has
  been busy calculating break up values well in excess of 100
  dlrs per share. Traders today described the buying in UAL as
  widespread, indicative to them that big institutions believe
  the stock is in play.
      Market sources have said that although Trump attracted
  attention to the stock, the pilots proposal acted as a
  catalyst, kicking off a new round of speculation and perhaps
  throwing the company into the hands of another buyer.
      ""The first domino is you have an investor with a
  considerable stake. the second domino is the union. That type
  of attitude has been a precursor to airline deals in the past,""
  said Pettee.
      ""What's interesting is the values are there. There's
  something for everybody,"" he said.

      In addition, HBO said its financial condition is improving
  rapidly as the result of a significant restructuring
  implemented in 1986.
      It expects the company to report net income of about 40 cts

  Japan's Agriculture Ministry, angered by
  U.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, will
  tell U.S. Officials at talks later this month that
  liberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan,
  a senior ministry official said.
      ""Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drives
  by other suppliers,"" the official, who declined to be named,
  said. ""Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products and
  it is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberalise
  its farm import market,"" he said.
      Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S.
  Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also open
  its wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated to
  protect local farmers.
      Australia and Canada could then increase their wheat
  exports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said.
  End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.
      U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due to
  visit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will ask
  Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers and
  remove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.
      Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Market
  share here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, has
  been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year
  beef accord next March 31.
      Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased sales
  from China and South America, while Japanese soybean imports
  from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, although
  the U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.
      U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its
  beef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain
  imports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.
      An indication of the U.S. Position came last December when
  Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has
  the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.
  Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representing
  some one billion dlrs in new business.
      The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs
  and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import
  controls on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,
  purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,
  prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.
      To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan's
  top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove
  residual import restrictions on agricultural products.
      But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional
  reaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issue
  should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the
  industrial sector.
      ""Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and these
  issues should not be discussed on the same table,"" the official
  said.

  U.S. military forces in the Mideast
  Gulf are under orders to protect only American flag vessels and
  occasional U.S. arms deliveries on other ships to
  ""non-belligerent"" states in the area, the Pentagon said today.
      ""No one has ever stated or supported a policy of protecting
  all shipping in those waters,"" Pentagon spokesman Bob Sims said
  as the Reagan Administration drew up plans to increase the
  protective U.S. military presence in the gulf.
      Sims denied published reports that U.S. Defense Secretary
  Caspar Weinberger sought air cover to protect all neutral
  shipping in the western gulf from attacks by Iran and Iraq.
      ""As we have said repeatedly, only American flag vessels are
  under our protection with the exception, on a limited
  case-by-case basis, of ships carrying our Foreign Military
  Sales equipment to friendly, non-belligerent states in the
  region,"" Sims said.
      U.S. warships in the gulf two weeks ago protected a Kuwaiti
  ship which sailed to Bahrain with U.S. arms for Bahrain and
  Kuwait. But Sims said Washington had received assurances that
  the the arms would not be used elsewhere.
      He said Kuwait, which is turning 11 oil tankers over to
  U.S. firms to fly the American flag and be protected by the
  U.S. warships, is not considered a belligerent despite Iranian
  charges that Kuwait is supporting Iraq in the gulf war.
      Kuwaiti tankers have come under repeated Iranian attack.
      Sims refused to say how the United States will beef up its
  seven-ship Middle East Task Force in the gulf to protect the 11
  Kuaiti tankers. But Pentagon officials said that additional
  ships and air cover are under consideration.

  Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)
  has drawn up a detailed plan calling for large tax cuts and an
  increase in government purchases of foreign goods, the head of
  the committee working out the plan, Junichiro Koizumi, said.
      The plan will also urge the government to double 1985's
  official development assistance to 7.6 billion dlrs within five
  years instead of seven as the government had promised, senior
  LDP officials said at a press conference.
      LDP executive council chairman Shintaro Abe will explain
  the plan to U.S. Officials when he visits the U.S. On April 19.
      Abe's visit is to prepare for Prime Minister Yasuhiro
  Nakasone's talks with President Ronald Reagan later this month.
      Koizumi said the LDP plan will not specify the size of the
  tax cut or the amount of domestic demand to be stimulated.
  However, top LDP executives will work out figures so that Abe
  will be able to offer specifics to U.S. Officials.
      The proposed increase in procurement of foreign goods by
  the government will probably include the purchase of super
  computers, LDP officials said.
      According to the plan, Japan will also strive to solve
  specific trade problems with other nations and will encourage
  flows of funds to developing countries, the officials said.
      The LDP expects the measures to prop up the economy and
  lessen trade problems with the U.S., They added.
      The basic ideas of the LDP's plan were presented to and
  welcomed by monetary authorities of the major industrial
  nations in Washington last week, they said.
      The LDP plan will form the basis for the last of several
  packages to stimulate Japanese domestic demand and will be
  unveiled by the government in late May.

test/17877,"VENEZUELA TIGHTENS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESTRICTIONS
  Venezuela's central bank has ordered
  Venezuelan banks and exchange houses to cease foreign exchange
  operations with brokers based outside the country, according to
  a copy of a central bank telex made available to Reuters.
      The measure, confirmed by a brokerage firm here, has
  effectively cut off all foreign participation in Venezuela's
  volatile currency market.
      The telex, issued on May 19, was signed by Carlos Hernandez
  Delfino, manager of the bank's department of international
  operations.
      The telex said the restriction on business with foreign
  brokers is in line with an earlier measure prohibiting foreign
  exchange houses from selling dollars or other foreign
  currencies to anyone living outside Venezuela.
      In recent weeks the Venezuelan government has denied
  rumours that it intends to impose foreign exchange controls to
  prop up the weakening bolivar.
      But brokers said the central bank's move is seen as a de
  facto currency control. ""It is definitely a control in the sense
  that there's no longer complete freedom to operate,"" one broker
  here said.
      ""Gradually they're imposing restrictions and the direction
  is towards complete control,"" the broker said.
      The broker, who requested anonymity, said virtually all his
  Venezuelan customers had stopped doing business with him since
  the central bank issued the telex and followed it up with
  telephone calls.
      He said that before the restriction was imposed the volume
  of his firm's transactions with Venezuela was about 10 mln dlrs
  a day. ""It was a frenetic market, it was really quite active,"" he
  said.
      The broker said he saw no logical explanation for the
  prohibition because his firm only acted act as an intermediary
  between Venezuelan brokers, exchange houses and banks.
      ""We weren't buying dollars from Venezuelans, that's
  ridiculous,"" he said. ""They've been on a rampage against
  foreigners.""
      The broker noted that two months ago Venezuela's central
  bank quietly announced that banks doing foreign exchange
  business outside Venezuela would have to respect a new 200 pct
  reserve requirement.
      In February, the central bank also prohibited trading in
  bolivar futures, the broker said.
      ""We used to have a forward market,"" he said. ""For a small
  currency it was miraculous.""
      He said the bolivar, which averaged 20.29 to the U.S.
  Dollar in 1986, would continue to slip from its current range
  of 28.35 to 28.50 because the central bank was rapidly running
  out of foreign reserves to support the currency on the free
  market.

  The Treasury Department said it
  notified the Netherlands that it was terminating the 1948
  income tax treaty as it applies to the Netherlands Antilles and
  Aruba.
      The termination is effective January 1, 1988, the Treasury
  said in a two-sentence announcement.
      The Treasury decided to end the treaty after negotiations
  between the United States and the Netherlands over the past
  eight years had failed to reach an accord, a Treasury spokesman
  said.
      The decision means the sale by U.S. parent companies of
  Eurobonds through Netherlands Antilles subsidiaries will no
  longer be free of the 30 pct U.S. withholding tax, the
  spokesman said.
      Terminating the tax treaty with the Netherlands Antilles 
  may cause bond issuers to call in the bonds early. Most have
  maturities of 10 years or less and were issued before 1984, the
  spokesman said.
      He said the Treasury did not expect the action to have an
  adverse effect on U.S. issuers of the bonds because the general
  decline in interest rates means they will be able to refinance
  at lower interest rates.
      However, the holders of the bonds presumably will be faced
  with lower yields.

  Revlon at 20.10 dlrs per common share in cash.
      MacAndrews said it increased its offer to purchase all

  offer of 18.50 dlrs a share.
      Following consummation of the offer, a unit of MacAndrews

      MacAndrews said it will promptly file revised tender offer

      Since the offer was made over a dozen shareholder lawsuits
  were brought against Revlon alleging the original offer was too
  low.
      But, the companies said these lawsuits have been settled in

  International Business Machines Corp
  has started the year aggressively, but industry analysts said
  the company still faces some tough rounds in its fight to stop
  a two-year earnings slump.
      ""I am more impressed with what's happening at IBM than I
  have been in a long time,"" said PaineWebber analyst Stephen
  Smith.
      ""But they're not out of the woods yet,"" he added.
      At 1.30 dlrs a share, IBM's first-quarter net income easily
  topped most estimates on Wall Street, which had ranged from an
  even dollar to 1.20 dlrs.
      Most analysts said they were pleasantly surprised by IBM's
  performance. But they indicated that IBM's chances for a full
  recovery hinged on several key factors whose impact will not be
  felt until later in the year.
      These include the success of IBM's new personal computer
  line, introduced two weeks ago, and its 9370 minicomputers,
  which will begin volume shipments in July.
      In addition, IBM has said the full benefits of its
  early-retirement program and other cost-cutting moves will
  emerge as the year progresses.
      Analysts noted that IBM chairman John F. Akers was
  relatively more upbeat in assessing the company's outlook than
  he has been for nearly a year.
      ""Although the worldwide economic situation remains
  unsettled, there are some encouraging signs in our business,""
  Akers said, pointing to, among other things, higher
  first-quarter shipments. ""We remain optimistic about the
  prospects for both the industry and IBM,"" he said.
      ""Akers was most encouraging,"" said PaineWebber's Smith.
      A weak dollar, a lower tax rate and strong mainframe
  computer sales all contributed to the better-than-expected
  first-quarter results, analysts said.
      ""Shipments of the 3090 mainframes were very strong in
  March,"" after a weak January and February, said Ulric Weil of
  Washington-based Weil and Associates.
      Sales of the top-of-the-line mainframes, commonly called
  the Sierras, ""bailed out the whole quarter,"" Weil said, adding,
  ""If this continues, it augers well for the rest of the year.""

      DOE alleged Trigon caused overcharges of 624,208 dlrs by

      It said the proposed settlements would resolve disputes

test/15625,"DOLLAR ENDS LOWER IN LACKLUSTRE FRANKFURT
  The dollar drifted down to end one
  pfennig lower after a lacklustre session, held in limits by the
  lack of concrete news from the Group of Seven meeting and
  comments on the edge of the Washington IMF/World Bank meeting.
      Dealers said the communique early in the European morning
  from the G-7 meeting contained no significant new factors and
  although the dollar dipped it generally resisted further
  attempts to push it lower through the day.
      The U.S. Currency ended at 1.8270/80 marks, below
  yesterday's last 1.8365/75.
      Koch said the assessment of the dollar's direction was
  based on a global view, with operators paying most attention to
  comments by finance officials to see how closely they stated
  adherence to international agreements such as those set at the
  Plaza Hotel in 1985 and in Paris on February 22.
      Koch described the wording of the communique from the G-7
  as ""soft as wax.""
      Bundebank vice-president Helmut Schlesinger told Reuters in
  a telephone interview that the German central bank sees no
  current reason to change monetary course at present.
      Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks
  yesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and West
  Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which dealers
  said revived some speculation that German interest rate cuts
  may be under consideration.
      German call money was slightly softer today, at around 3.70
  pct after 3.80 yesterday.
      Some dealers said rates on new liquidity injections added
  via Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements may be cut next
  week. Hopes of a cut were dashed on Tuesday with an allocation
  at an unchanged 3.80 pct.
      But speaking of the pact tender rate next week, Schlesinger
  said, ""since the central bank council gives its opinion on this
  theme only every 14 days, this is hardly probable.""
      Euromark rates scarcely responded to the central bankers
  comments, with six months funds ending unaltered at around
  3-7/8 pct. Eurodollars for the same maturity rose a fractional
  1/16 pct from yesterday to around 6-11/16 pct.
      Sterling dipped to end at 2.952/956 marks after 2.960/965
  last night. The Swiss franc firmed slightly to 120.30/45 marks
  per 100 from 120.25/40, with the yen soaring however to
  1.2570/90 marks per 100 from 1.2515/35 yesterday.
      EMS currencies saw the French franc end unchanged from last
  night at 30.03/06 marks per 100, with the Belgian franc easing
  however to 4.829/831 marks per 100 from 4.831/833.

  The 37,635 deadweight tonnes bulk carrier
  Cumberlande, which sank in the South Pacific last Friday, was
  carrying a cargo which included lead as well as magnesium ore,
  a Lloyds Shipping Intelligence spokesman said.
      He was unable to confirm the tonnages involved.
      Trade reports circulating the London Metal Exchange said
  the vessel, en route to New Orleans from Newcastle, New South
  Wales, had been carrying 10,000 tonnes of lead concentrates.
  Traders said this pushed lead prices higher in early morning
  trading as the market is currently sensitive to any fundamental
  news due to its finely balanced supply/demand position and low
  stocks.
      Trade sources said that 10,000 tonnes of lead concentrates
  could convert to around 5,000 tonnes of metal, although this
  depended on the quality of the concentrates.
      A loss of this size could cause a gap in the supply
  pipeline, particularly in North America, they noted. Supplies
  there have been very tight this year and there is a strike at
  one major producer, Cominco, and labour talks currently being

test/21277,"TRANSATLANTIC ROW IMPERILS LOUVRE ACCORD-DEALERS
  The Louvre accord on currency stability,
  which has maintained an uneasy calm in currency markets since
  last February, appeared in serious danger today as a
  transatlantic dispute over West German interest rates came to
  the boil, foreign exchange dealers said.
      But as the dollar slid against the mark and world stock and
  bond markets plunged, officials in the major industrial
  countries played down the dispute as a bilateral problem
  between the United States and West Germany and insisted that
  the currency pact was still alive.
      U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker sparked the market
  fears when he attacked the rise in West German short-term
  interest rates. ""That's not in keeping with the spirit of what
  we agreed to as recently as earlier this month in Washington,""
  Baker said in a U.S. Television interview on Sunday. He was
  referring to the meetings of Finance Ministers from the Group
  of Seven (G7) leading industrial nations which reaffirmed the
  pact.
      Under the Louvre Accord West Germany and Japan, who both
  have large trade surpluses, pledged to boost their economic
  growth to take in more exports from the U.S., While the U.S.
  Agreed to stop talking the dollar down.
      However, Baker said on Saturday that while the Louvre
  agreement was still operative, the West German interest rate
  move would force the U.S. To re-examine the accord.
      ""The foreign exchange market has been told by Baker that
  he's going to hammer Germany ... He has just declared all bets
  are off in terms of currency cooperation,"" Chris Johns, currency
  analyst at UBS-Phillips and Drew in London said.
      But a Bank of Japan official took a much more sanguine
  view, telling Reuters that ""the exchange market is apparently
  reacting too much, and anyone who sold the dollar on the Baker
  comment will regret it later on.""
      French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, who hosted the
  Louvre meeting, was the only one of the G7 Finance Ministers to
  respond directly to Baker's remarks. He called for ""a faithful
  and firm adherence by all the major industrial countries to the
  Louvre accords -- in both their letter and spirit.""
      Neither the West German Finance Ministry nor the British
  Treasury commented on the row.
      But a Japanese Finance Ministry official said that despite
  U.S. Frustration over higher interest rates abroad, ""this does
  not represent its readiness to scrap the basic framework of the
  Louvre Accord.""
      In Frankfurt F. Wilhelm Christians, joint chief executive
  of West Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank, said that
  following recent meetings with Baker, he believed that the U.S.
  Was still committed to the accord.
      In a move which the market interpreted as a possible
  gesture of reconciliation, the Bundesbank added short-term
  liquidity to the West German money market at 3.80 pct on
  Monday, down from the 3.85 pct level at which it injected
  medium-term liquidity last week. The Bank of France also
  stepped into the French money market to hold down rates,
  injecting short-term liquidity at 7-3/4 pct after rates rose
  close to eight pct.

  seeks to create a common market stretching from Ethiopia in the

  U.S. analysts expect the American
  Petroleum Institute's weekly report on oil inventories to show
  a slight build in U.S. stocks of gasoline for the week ended
  May 29, oil traders and analysts said.
      While the consensus is for an increase, a few would not
  rule out the possibility of an decline. Traders said that
  barring any surprises in tonight's report, they expect the
  report to be neutral to bearish for oil prices.
      Heating oil stocks are also likely to build and runs to be
  steady to slightly higher, which could add pressure on oil
  prices, the analysts said.
      Crude oil was seen likely to build assuming imports
  continue at relatively high levels.
      Analysts expect gasoline stocks to rise 500,000 to two mln
  barrels above the 234 mln reported for May 22.
      Peter Beutel, oil analyst with Elders Futures inc, who
  looks for a build said, ""We have had five weeks of gasoline
  demand at 7.3 mln bpd or more and it is likely to taper off to
  between 6.7-7.0 mln bpd, which should make stocks build. Demand
  would have to stay above 7.0 mln bpd to have a draw,"" he added.
      Rising demand is why oil traders and analysts expect a draw
  in stocks of about of about one mln barrels.
     
      The U.S. Energy Information Administration in its latest
  report for the four weeks ending may 22 said that gasoline
  demand was up 4.4 pct to 7.3 mln bpd from the previous year.
      But analysts said hopes of reduced stocks is likely to
  founder on increased runs in refineries, which could be up 0.3
  pct above May 22's 81.2 pct capacity operated.
      Such an increase would raise runs about 100,000 bpd and add
  to U.S. stocks.
      But some analysts said that refiners may have held refinery
  runs.
      Heating oil stocks were also expected to build between
  700,000 barrels and one mln from the 96 mln barrel level
  reported last week, but a rise in distillate stocks was
  discounted as having a market impact at this time.
      ""A build is seasonal now and not out of line with last year,""
  one futures analyst said.
      Analysts said they also expect crude oil stocks to build
  between 1.5 mln barrels and three mln from the 325 mln barrels
  reported by API for the week of may 22.
      The consensus appears for about two mln barrels to be added
  to the nation's inventory.

test/18136,"LEUTWILER WANTS FIRMER MARK AGAINST SFR
  Fritz Leutwiler, chairman of
  BBC AG Brown Boveri und Cie and a former Swiss National Bank
  president, urged the National Bank to declare its intent of
  achieving a rising rate for the mark against the Swiss franc.
      In a speech to shareholders, Leutwiler said, ""A gradually
  rising rate for the mark in relation to the franc would be
  desirable from the standpoint of industrial exports and with
  regard to sustaining Swiss industry.""
      ""Simply an appropriate declaration of intent by our bank of
  issue (Swiss National Bank) could have a positive effect,"" he
  said.
      Leutwiler, who served 10 years as head of the Swiss central
  bank, said such a step would not contradict the National Bank's
  target of monetary stability.
      ""Bringing the franc close to the mark would, of course, have
  to be done step by step under the watchful eye of monetary
  policy,"" he told shareholders. ""Realistically there is in fact no
  persuasive reason why the German currency is quoted almost 20
  pct lower than the Swiss.""
      A National Bank spokesman said the relation of the mark and
  Swiss franc was an example of stable currency parities over a
  long period of time.
      The spokesman said exchange rates were made by the market,
  not the central bank, and it would be impossible to influence
  individual parities separately.
      Leutwiler said the Swiss National Bank could not support
  the value of the dollar, even in conjunction with other central
  banks, without putting monetary stability in jeopardy.
      ""I would be the last to recommend that. The key to a
  stronger dollar lies in the United States itself,"" Leutwiler
  said.

      The sale excludes certain real estate assets of Joske's and

  30 mln dlrs based on current market conditions.
      Joske's has 26 stores in Texas and one in Arizona.

  unit Allied has slated for sale in its restructuring.
      Allied Stores Corp, a subsidiary of Campeau Corp, was

      Robert Campeau, chairman of Allied, said ""this is a
  terrific start to our disposition program which is proceeding
  well ahead of schedule. This sale will fulfill the requirements
  under our bank agreements to sell certain assets by June 30 and
  give us additional flexibility in the disposal of the remaining
  divisions being sold.""
       Allied Stores is required to pay 200 mln dlrs in bank debt
  by June 30. There had been some doubts on Wall Street that the
  company could meet the payment.
      A Campeau source said, ""We believe this cash sale puts us
  in a very strong negotiating position to maximize the proceeds
  Allied can receive from its other divisions.""
      ""Allied was able to put itself in a position where it knows

test/20462,"U.S. TAKES TOUGH STAND ON GATT FARM ISSUES
  The United States is prepared to ""pull out
  all the stops"" to defend its agricultural trade rights under the
  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), U.S. Ambassador
  to GATT Michael Samuels said.
      Those rights are now being challenged by the European
  Community's (EC) agricultural support policies, he told a
  conference sponsored by the American Soybean Association.
      He reiterated Washington's firm intention to retaliate if
  the EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef without
  the issue being investigated by a GATT special committee.
      The U.S. claims the EC directive, due to come into effect
  on January 1, threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of U.S. meat
  shipments into the EC.
      The U.S. also will oppose all EC efforts to impair U.S.
  trade via the EC oilseeds regime, which supports EC oilseed
  prices over the current market level and which may be extended
  to include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax, Samuels said.
      Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies,
  an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral trade
  negotiations, ""is meaningless if import barriers continue to be
  erected,"" Samuels said.
      Samuels called the U.S. plan to eliminate world farm
  subsidies by the year 2000, proposed at GATT in July, ""visionary""
  and ""very serious.""  The EC and Japan have said it is
  unrealistic.
      The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposal
  on farm trade reform, expected to be tabled at GATT formally
  next week.
      The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reduce
  tensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cereals
  substitutes, dairy and sugar. It also calls for reduction of
  farm subsidies.
      The U.S. Is not opposed to short-term measures, as long as
  they are directly linked to long-term commitments to end major
  trade distortions, Samuels said.
      Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formally
  submitted and respond to it officially then.
      ""We will consider its relation to the Punta del Este
  declaration to correct trade problems and expand market access,""
  the U.S. Ambassador said.
      The U.S. can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignores
  the U.S. plan when it tables its own proposal, he added.
      The key difference between the two approaches is that the
  U.S. wants farm subsidies eliminated, while the EC is pushing
  only for a reduction in farm suppports, Samuels said.
      If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze,
  there would be little incentive for the Community to work to
  correct the international trade situation, he added.
      Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint, the EC
  oilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports to
  third countries as three crucial barriers to trade which the
  U.S. wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT.

  (six miles) from Basra, but admitted the Iranians had occupied
  ground held by the Mohammed al-Qassem unit, one of three

  the last foothold"" occupied by the Iranians, it said.
      (Iran said its troops had killed or wounded more than 4,000
  Iraqis and were stabilising their new positions.)

  installations at Iran's southwestern Ahvaz field during a raid
  today. It denied an Iranian report that an Iraqi jet was shot
  down.
      Iraq also reported a naval battle at the northern tip of

  The investor group that has agreed to
  buy &lt;Computerland Corp> will likely take the leading personal
  computer retailer public or sell it to other investors,
  industry analysts said.
      ""Now's a good time,"" said Joe Levy of International Data
  Corp. ""The personal computer industry has bottomed out and is
  on the way up again,"" he said.
      Earlier today, closely held Computerland, the largest PC
  retailing chain in the country, said it agreed to be bought by
  an investor group led by E.M. Warburg Pincus and Co, New York.
      Neither Computerland, which is 96 pct owned by its founder,
  William H. Millard, nor E.M. Warburg, a money management and
  venture capital firm, would disclose the value of the
  transaction.
      Analysts estimated that Computerland, whose 800 stores
  generated 1.4 billion dlrs in sales last year, would fetch  150
  mln dlrs to 250 mln dlrs. Computerland franchise owners pay
  royalties averaging 5.9 pct to the parent company.
      Officials for E.M. Warburg referred all questions to
  Computerland. Computerland officials could not immediately be
  reached for comment.
      E.M. Warburg currently manages 1.5 billion dlrs in venture
  capital funds, and its past investments have included Mattel
  Inc &lt;MAT> and the Ingersoll newspaper chain. It is also a money
  manager, with 3.5 billion dlrs under management.
     Although the PC retailers are benefitting from the strong
  upturn in PC sales, analysts said Computerland must make key
  changes if it is to fend off advances from rivals like
  Businessland Inc &lt;BUSL.O> and Tandy Corp's &lt;TAN> Radio Shack
  stores. ""The name of the game now is outbound sales forces,
  customer service and customer support,"" said Levy of
  International Data.
  
      Relations between Computerland and its franchise owners
  have mellowed recently after Millard was forced to give up
  managment control of the company in 1985.
      Ed Faber, who took over as chairman and chief executive
  officer, revamped the company's royalty plan, which help quell
  much of the franchisee dissent.

  Secretary James Baker that the U.S. Would take another look at

      The accords were reaffirmed by the Group of Seven Finance
  Ministers in Washington last month.
      But Baker said at the weekend that the West German rate
  rise was ""not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to.""
      ""What I'm really saying is that they should not expect us to
  simply sit back here and accept increased tightening on their

  Norway is expected to seek a compromise
  solution to defuse a row between Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap
  A/S &lt;STAT.OL> (Statoil) and Conoco Norge A/S over which firm
  will operate the Heidrun oil field, government sources said.
      The sources, who asked not to be named, said the government
  will likely recommend that Conoco be allowed to continue as the
  field's operator through the development phase, with Statoil
  taking over only after production starts in the early 1990s.
      Oil Minister Arne Oeien told Reuters the government had
  today discused the Heidrun matter but that no final decision
  had been taken and several questions remained unresolved.
      It was unlikely the government would announce its decision
  on Heidrun operatorship until after Thursday's cabinet meeting
  and after discussing a proposed solution with both companies,
  the sources added.
      This spring Norway's state-owned oil company Statoil
  exercised an option in the Heidrun field exploration license
  that, if approved by the government, would allow it to relieve
  Conoco as Heidrun operator, a move sharply criticised by
  Conoco.
      Heidrun is often cited by the government and industry as
  the most likely candidate for the first field development
  project on the Haltenbanken exploration tract off central
  Norway.

  share bid by CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S>.
      Alternatively, ETL will offer three shares plus 82 cents
  cash for each Monier share, it said in a statement.

  Friday.
      It now holds 14.99 pct, the maximum allowed without Foreign

  foreign because of its New Zealand base.
      The ETL cash offer values Monier's issued capital of 156.28

      Based on the current price of ETL shares of 1.05 dlrs, the
  alternative is worth 3.97 dlrs per share, but ETL said the
  value placed on its shares for the offer aproximates to the
  diluted asset backing of ETL as at March 31.
      ETL said the offer will have no minimum acceptance
  conditions and will be subject to Australian foreign investment
  and U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust clearances.
      ETL chairman Allan Hawkins said in the statement that the
  shareholding in Monier was a long term investment.
      ETL and its &lt;Feltex International Ltd> associate have
  targetted the building products sector as an area of expansion
  and Monier fits well with this aim, he added.

  that the independent directors of Monier intend to recommend
  acceptance of the ETL bid in the absence of a higher bid.
      He also said Monier will not now proceed with the
  one-for-two bonus issue announced with its interim results on
  March 19 in view of the proposed takeover bids.
      As previously reported, the CSR offer involves a complex
  put and call option deal with Monier's major shareholder,
  Redland Plc &lt;RDLD.L>, which gives Redland the choice of
  accepting the CSR offer for its 49.8 pct stake or moving to
  50.1 pct within six months of the bid closing.
      CSR officials have made it clear that they see Redland
  taking the second option, resulting in the two companies
  running Monier as a joint venture.
      CSR officials have also said they had no intention of
  raising the company's bid for Monier after ETL's intervention
  became public last week.

  A senior Abu Dhabi oil official said
  in remarks published today the emirate, largest producer in the
  United Arab Emirates (UAE), was succeeding in marketing its
  crude oil without breaching OPEC accords.
      Khalaf al-Oteiba, Marketing Director at the Abu Dhabi
  National Oil Co (ADNOC), told the company's Petroleum Community
  magazine ADNOC was also keen to keep good customer relations.
  ""The company will maintain its dialogue with and care for its
  customers in accordance with market conditions...And take
  necessary steps to guarantee marketing its production,"" he said.
     ""The present oil marketing policy of ADNOC is based on
  adherence to OPEC decisions of December 1986 to control
  production and establish a new pricing system in an attempt to
  stabilize the market,"" he added.
      OPEC agreed last December to limit production to 15.8 mln
  bpd and return to fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel.
      Oteiba said stabilization of the oil market in the future
  depended on how much discipline OPEC showed.
      Oteiba said last year, when world oil prices dropped, was
  ADNOC's most difficult ever but ""a practical and flexible
  pricing policy was implemented to relate to the changed market
  environment.""
      He said crude oil sales last year jumped to an average
  609,000 bpd of which 73 pct was exported. Refined product sales
  totalled eight mln metric tonnes, of which 67 pct was exported.
      In 1985, ADNOC marketed a total of 476,000 bpd of crude oil
  and 7.2 mln tonnes of refined products.

test/20270,"NORWAY BOOSTS OIL OUTPUT BY 22 PCT IN SEPTEMBER
  Norway's September oil output rose by 22.2
  pct to 1.07 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 830,492 bpd in
  August, according to a Reuter survey of firms operating here.
      Operators said the sharp rise reflected higher output at
  several of Norway's biggest fields and resumed production at
  fields shut down for 27 days in August for the Ekofisk field
  rescue project.
      Industry analysts said the increase did not exceed Norway's
  voluntary move to curb by 7.5 pct planned growth in its oil
  output, a move designed to back OPEC-led efforts to stabilise
  oil prices by limiting supplies to world crude markets.
      Norway, not an OPEC member, decided in June to extend the
  production restraints, enforced since February 1 1987, on all
  its North Sea fields for the rest of the year.
      Oil Minister Arne Oeien said last month he expected Norway
  would extend into 1988 its policy of slowed production growth.
      The biggest increase was seen on the Ekofisk field, which
  pumped 168,023 bpd in September against 48,195 bpd in August,
  field operator Phillips Petroleum Norway Inc said.
      Ekofisk and the nearby Valhall and Ula fields, which use
  the Ekofisk pipeline, were shut down for most of August while
  Phillips raised Ekofisk platforms to counter seabed subsidence.
      BP Petroleum Development Norway Ltd, operator of the Ula
  field, said September output rose to 86,727 bpd after dropping
  to 27,237 bpd in August because of the shutdown.
      Valhall, operated by Amoco Norway A/S, flowed 74,694 bpd
  last month compared with 69,748 bpd in August, the company
  said.
      September production was also sharply higher at the
  Statfjord field. Norway's 84 pct share of Statfjord, which
  extends into the British North Sea sector, was 611,138 bpd
  against 552,646 bpd in August, operator Den Norske Stats
  Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) said.
      Norway's 22.2 pct share of the Murchison field which, like
  Statfjord, extends into the British sector, yielded 15,388 bpd
  in September, a slight 920 bpd decrease from the previous
  month, Norwegian partners on the British-operated field said.
      Statoil boosted output at its Gullfaks field to 109,670 bpd
  in September, compared with 100,188 in August.
      Norsk Hydro, operator of the Oseberg field, said test
  output at the field from the mobile production ship Petro Jarl
  totalled 1,719 bpd last month, down sharply from 16,170 bpd in
  August.
      Hydro said the drop was caused by failure to bring on
  stream a second well, cutting September production to just two
  days.

test/20048,"TOKYO STOCK PLUNGE COULD FORCE EASIER MONEY POLICY
  Plunging Tokyo stock prices will prevent
  the Bank of Japan from raising its discount rate and could even
  force it to ease monetary policy if the collapse continues,
  government and private economists said.
      A rise in interest rates now would only serve to spark
  further selling of shares that could ultimately have a major
  deflationary impact on the real economy, they said.
      Although Bank of Japan officials have consistently
  maintained that they had no plans to raise the 2.5 pct discount
  rate, many in the markets have thought otherwise. 
      Fears of a rise in the discount rate were fanned by the
  central bank's apparent decision last week to countenance
  higher rates on commercial bills, dealers said.
      But today's stock market collapse -- prices fell nearly 15
  pct -- means that the Bank of Japan would be hard pressed to
  raise the discount rate now, despite its concerns about a
  renewed outbreak of inflation, dealers and economists said.
      Japanese government bond prices rose sharply today as the
  markets concluded that the stock market's collapse precluded
  the central bank from carrying out the widely-rumoured discount
  rate increase.
      A senior government economist suggested that both the U.S.
  And Japan needed to ease monetary policy now to prevent a
  further drop in New York and Tokyo stock prices. ""They need to
  support the stock and security markets,"" he said.
      But Bank of Japan officials said they saw no need to change
  policy for the moment, although one admitted that the central
  bank may have to rethink its strategy if Tokyo stock prices
  continue to plunge during the rest of the week.
      Both government and Bank of Japan economists agreed the
  economy is better placed now to cope with the deflationary
  impact of plunging stock prices than it was a few months ago.
      With the economy recovering strongly, the steep drop in
  stock prices is not likely to put a major dent in consumer and
  business confidence, one government economist said.
      ""There will be some impact on the real economy, but it won't
  be that big,"" said another.
      Individuals are not heavily invested in stocks on their
  own, although they do participate through trust funds and other
  investment vehicles. And while many manufacturing firms turned
  to financial market investments for profits during last year's
  economic downturn, the recent rebound has allowed them to
  refocus their attention on their core businesses, he said.
      Paradoxically, it is the pick-up in the economy that is
  partly to blame for the stock market collapse as companies have
  shifted funds away from financial investments to increase
  inventories and step up capital spending, one government
  economist said.
      In deciding what response to make to the steep stock price
  drop, the Bank of Japan must first determine whether prices
  will continue to fall further and then decide if they pose a
  greater economic danger than the threat of higher inflation,
  one central bank official said. ""That will at least take a
  couple of days, if not weeks,"" he said.

  Top-level talks last week between the
  European Community (EC) and the United States failed to resolve
  a dispute over pasta which may provoke new trade frictions next
  month, diplomatic sources said.
      The U.S. Insists the EC complies with what it regards as an
  unambiguous ruling from the world trade body GATT and
  dismantles an export subsidy system which has led to Italy
  taking an increasing share of the U.S. Pasta market.
      The sources said the EC, which currently provides subsidies
  of around 16 cents a pound, offered a compromise in last week's
  talks in Brussels but that this was rejected by the U.S.
      U.S. Assistant Special Trade Representative Jim Murphy has
  returned to Washington ahead of a theoretical July 1 deadline
  for agreement, set last August when the two sides resolved a
  related dispute over EC restrictions on U.S. Citrus imports.
      The diplomatic sources said the citrus issue could be
  reopened if the pasta dispute was not solved quickly. It was
  also possible the U.S. Would reimpose a 40 pct tariff on EC
  pasta, lifted when the citrus row was settled.
      But the two sides may agree to extend the deadline for a
  few days as EC Commissioners Willy de Clercq and Frans
  Andriessen are due to visit Washington from July 7 to 10.

  A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome
  Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO>
  may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the door
  for more takeover bids, oil analysts said.
      Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt
  of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim
  debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer
  substantial payments to creditors will expire.
      Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders
  that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan.
      Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as
  public noteholders in March after several months of delicate
  negotiations.
      TransCanada's proposal ""amounts to a quasi debt
  restructuring,"" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker
  Ltd said from Toronto.
      Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow
  creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet
  to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to
  cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.
      ""The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that
  even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that
  Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,""
  said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in
  Calgary.
      TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome
  was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed
  refinancing packages, Gobert said.
      The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome
  since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders
  to agree to a restructuring, he added.
      ""I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain
  any and all offers (for Dome),"" Gobert said.
      Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that
  TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix
  the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other
  possible buyers from making an offer. ""By drawing attention to
  us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little
  reluctant to come forward,"" he said.
      Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal
  offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a
  confidential agreement between the two companies, he said.
      Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions
  with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other
  unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and
  financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including
  TransCanada's.
      Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price
  for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.
      However, he said not enough financial details are known
  about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of
  TransCanada's proposed offer.

  The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation
  (FAO) said global wheat and coarse grain output was likely to
  fall in 1987 but supplies would remain adequate to meet demand.
      FAO said in its monthly food outlook bulletin total world
  grain output was expected to fall 38 mln tonnes to 1,353 mln in
  1987, due mainly to unusually high winter losses in the Soviet
  Union, drought in China and reduced plantings in North America.
      World cereal stocks at the end of 1986/87 were forecast to
  rise 47 mln tonnes to a record 452 mln tonnes, softening the
  impact of reduced production. But stocks are unevenly
  distributed, with about 50 pct held by the U.S.
      ""Thus the food security prospects in 1987/88 for many
  developing countries, particularly in Africa, depend crucially
  on the outcome of this year's harvests,"" FAO said.
      FAO said world cereal supplies in 1986/87 were estimated at
  a record 2,113 mln tonnes, about five pct higher than last
  season and due mainly to large stocks and a record 1986
  harvest, estimated at 1,865 mln tonnes.
      FAO's forecast of 1986/87 world cereals trade was revised
  upwards by eight mln tonnes to 179 mln due to the likelihood of

  Glynwed International Plc &lt;GLYN.L> said it
  had bought all the issued shares of two companies belonging to
  Gallaher Ltd, a subsidiary of American Brands Inc &lt;AMB>, in a
  deal worth around 14 mln stg.
      The full names of the companies purchased from Gallaher are
  &lt;Formatura Iniezione Polimeri Spa>, Genoa and &lt;FIP U.K. Ltd>,
  Weybridge.
      Consideration for the purchases, which will be based on the
  net asset values per share of the companies, has yet to be
  finalised but some nine mln stg of the total represents debt
  assumed by Glynwed.
      FIP is a manufacturer of valves and other pressure pipe
  fittings in thermoplastics. Its products are complementary to
  those of Glynwed subsidiaries, Durapipe U.K. And Philmac.
      The acquisitions appreciably develop and strengthen
  Glynwed's strategic position in the thermoplastic pipework
  systems market.
      The sale by Gallaher reflects a decision to dispose of more
  peripheral businesses. Proceeds of the sale will be used in the
  continuing expansion of the Gallaher group. Glynwed shares were
  up 5p to 494 after the announcement. Gallaher is not quoted on
  the London Stock Exchange.

  American lawmakers rallied behind
  President Reagan for the U.S. strike against Iranian targets in
  the Gulf but the attack fueled a sharp new White House-Congress
  debate over limits on his powers to make war.
      The Pentagon announced on Monday that U.S. warships
  destroyed a non-producing oil platform used for monitoring Gulf
  ship traffic and military operations, and also raided a second
  Iranian oil rig in retaliation for an earlier Iranian attack on
  a Kuwaiti ship flying the American flag.
      Many Democrats, who control Congress, and Republicans
  expressed support for the attack and praised it as an
  appropriate ""measured response.""
      But Democrats and liberal Republicans voiced new fears that
  the growing confrontation between Tehran and the United States
  could erupt into a major war, and demanded that Reagan comply
  with the 1973 War Powers Act, which could lead to a pullout of
  American forces from the waterway.
      ""Those who contend the strike was necessary must realize
  their words are easily construed as a tacit endorsement of war
  with Iran,"" said Sen Mark Hatfield of Oregon, a Republican.

  A.H. Robins Co said its board
  has concluded that the merger proposal submitted by Rorer Group
  Inc &lt;ROR> merits further consideration.
      At the request of the board, Rorer has agreed to extend
  until 1800 EDT July 2 its deadline for response from A.H.
  Robins.
      After Rorer announced its second bid for the company last
  Thursday, analysts forecast that the Robins family, which holds
  control of the company, would vigourously oppose any merger.
      But, the analysts added, that Robins desire to emerge
  independent from two years of bankruptcy proceedings may be
  thwarted by some Robins' shareholders who perceive a merger as
  a more expedient way of dealing with the company's Dalkon
  Shield related liabilities.
      After a failed first attempt earlier this year, Rorer's
  latest merger plan calls for a share swap worth about 720 mln
  dlrs.
      Rorer would also set up two trusts to cover the estimated
  1.75 billion dlrs in liabilities to deal with about 320,000
  claims by women who suffered maladies from the use of the
  Dalkon Shield interuterine device.

test/16072,"U.S. MARKETS OFFER GLIMPSE OF VOLCKER NIGHTMARE
  Today's turmoil in the U.S. Financial
  markets, with bond and stock prices tumbling in the dollar's
  wake, is evidence of a major shift in investor psychology that
  is likely to spell more turbulence ahead, economists said.
      For two years, the markets had hailed the dollar's decline
  as the cure-all for the U.S. Trade deficit. Interest rates fell
  sharply and Wall Street became a one-way street, up.
      But that confidence is now cracking as the financial
  markets suddenly believe Fed chairman Paul Volcker's
  often-repeated warnings about the risks of a dollar collapse.
      ""Volcker's been saying for a long time that a dollar
  freefall would be extremely dangerous - now he's got it,"" said
  David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.
      The dollar fell below 144 yen today for the first time in
  40 years as the Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington
  failed to convince the foreign exchange market that they have a
  credible strategy for redressing global trade imbalances, short
  of further depreciation of the dollar.
      Bonds suffered their biggest one-day drop in months amid
  worries that the dollar's slide will rekindle inflation, scare
  away foreign investors and force the Fed to tighten credit.
      The inflationary fears boosted gold bullion by more than 12
  dlrs to a 1987 high of 432.20/70 dlrs an ounce, while the spike
  in interest rates pulled the Dow Jones Industrial Average down
  by 33 points to 2339.
      Norman Robertson, Mellon Bank chief economist, called the
  markets' instability frightening. He believes economic
  fundamentals do not justify the bearishness but said that ""once
  you start the ball rolling it's difficult to stop.""
      ""There's a stark possibility that you could get a
  destabilizing drop in the dollar that forces up interest rates
  and drives us into recession. The markets are in a panic.""
      Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics
  in Washington, has been warning for a long time that the
  controlled decline of the dollar since peaks of 3.47 marks and
  264 yen in February 1985 could turn into a nightmare.
      ""We're still more or less on track for a hard landing... But
  the agony may be fairly drawn out,"" Marris told Reuters.
      Marris does not expect the crisis to peak until later this
  year, but he warned that the situation is so fragile that it
  would take very little to touch off what he calls the second
  phase of the hard landing, whereby a loss of confidence in the
  dollar pushes up interest rates and leads to a recession.
      The stock market's reaction today and its sharp drop on
  March 30 shows how the loss of confidence could come about.
      The fact that it has not happened yet is consistent with
  historical experience, which teaches that domestic markets are
  not affected until a currency is in the final stages of its
  decline, Marris said. He has forecast a drop to about 125 yen.
      Marris felt that a major impetus for the dollar's latest
  weakness was the loss of credibility that central banks
  suffered when they failed to prevent the dollar from falling
  below 150 yen, the floor that the market believes was set as
  part of the G-7 Paris agreement in February.
      Robertson at Mellon, by contrast, said the loss of
  confidence was triggered last week when Washington announced
  plans to slap 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on Japanese electronic
  imports, raising the specter of a debilitating trade war.
      Many economists believe that long-run stability will not
  return to the markets until the root cause of the trade gap is
  addressed - excessive consumption in the U.S., Reflected in the
  massive budget deficit.
      But in the short term, given the failure of the G-7 and of
  central bank intervention, some feel that the Fed will have no
  choice but to tighten credit to restore faith in the dollar.
      ""The only thing that will stop the dollar falling is a
  substantial increase in the discount rate and a corresponding
  cut abroad, at least by Japan,"" said Lanston's Jones.
      Marris expects the Fed to act quickly to raise interest
  rates, even at the risk of increasing the debt burden for
  American farmers, Latin American governments and others.
      But Robert Giordano, chief economist at Goldman Sachs and
  Co, scoffed at the notion. ""It's ridiculous to think the Federal
  Reserve will raise interest rates when the dollar is weak
  against just one currency. This is yen strength, not dollar

      Giordano said the market was ignoring the progress being
  made toward reducing the U.S. Budget deficit.
      ""We're going to have one of the biggest reductions in the
  budget deficit relative to GNP in history this year, and nobody
  cares,"" he said, noting that only the deficit cut in 1968-69
  will have been greater.
      He said he does not expect the dollar to collapse and
  thinks interest rates are likely to fall back later this year.
      But for now, market psychology has changed so abruptly that
  a further drop in the bond market cannot be ruled out. ""Put on

  The European Community (EC) has
  effectively given Japan six weeks to take moves to open its
  market to imports before it decides on possible tough
  retaliatory trade measures, EC diplomats said.
      They said EC foreign ministers will meet on May 25 and 26
  to review the state of trade relations between the two sides.
      The EC executive commission was asked by representatives of
  member states on Friday to propose a renunciation of some EC
  pledges to the world trade body, GATT, unless there are
  ""adequate and early measures to open the Japanese market.""
      Such a renunciation would be the first step to imposing
  stiff increases in duties, or quantitative limits, on Japanese
  exports.
      The diplomats said it was unlikely that the issue would be
  discussed in detail at the next meeting of EC foreign ministers
  on April 27 and 28 in Luxembourg as time was needed to prepare
  proposals for possible retaliatory action.
      They said the commission has powers to take some limited
  action before getting ministerial approval to prevent Japanese
  exports of electrical, photographic and other goods being
  diverted to Europe following of possible U.S. Tariff moves.
      In May, the ministers are also likely to discuss how to
  prevent Japan from getting an extra trading advantage as a
  result of Spain and Portugal joining the bloc, which obliges
  them gradually to reduce tariffs on many industrial goods.
      Japan's trade surplus with the Community has grown
  steadily, registering a record 2.13 billion dlrs in March.

  U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
  Lyng said he is pleased the European Community plans to offer a
  global farm reform plan at GATT later this month, although the
  United States opposes key parts of the proposal.
      ""We're pleased that they have moved in tabling a proposal.
  It will help us in getting the negotiations underway,"" Lyng
  told Reuters in an interview Tuesday.
      Lyng's comment came after EC ministers in Luxembourg
  endorsed a farm reform package drafted by the EC Commission.
  The EC plan will be presented at the next meeting of Uruguay
  round agriculture negotiators in Geneva on October 26.
      Lyng said the United States would oppose parts of the plan
  seeking a market sharing agreement for grains, and proposing
  curbs on U.S. soybean and cereal substitute exports to Europe.
      The U.S. in July proposed to GATT the elimination of all
  farm subsidies affecting trade within ten years, and has
  pressed the EC to make a counter-offer with the aim of reaching
  a global farm subsidy agreement by the end of 1988.
      However, the EC and some U.S. domestic groups have said the
  Reagan administration plan to end all farm trade subsidies is
  unrealistic.
      Asked about such criticism, Lyng said ""The alternative to
  doing that is to say that we preserve them and maintain them. I
  think that is the unrealistic position.""
      ""I would suggest that they (EC) listen to what we are
  trying to say.""
      Lyng also rejected suggestions the U.S. and EC agree a
  freeze in export subsidies to get the GATT negotiations 
  started.
      ""All that some countries would like to have would be a
  wheat agreement where we would stop export subsidies on wheat.
  That doesn't do a thing for us,"" Lyng said.
      The United States wants an end to subsidies in a range of
  agricultural products from dairy products to vegetable oils, he
  said.
      At the GATT negotiators meeting next week Canada is
  expected to offer a proposal as well as the EC.
      The United States will be represented at the meeting by
  former agriculture undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, recently
  appointed special U.S. negotiator on agriculture.

  Commission today.

  ports of Sydney, Newcastle and Port Kembla, they said.
      The industrial action at the NSW ports is part of the week

  protest changes to the state's workers' compensation laws.
      The shipping sources said the various port unions appear to
  be taking it in turn to work for a short time at the start of
  each shift and then to walk off.
      Cargo handling in the ports has been disrupted, with
  container movements most affected, but has not stopped

  Foster Wheeler Corp &lt;FWC> said an
  audit of its Stearns Airport Equiment Co Inc unit, revealed
  ""substantial discrepancies"" in Stearns accounts that may
  require material adjustments to previously announce
  consolidated results of the company and its subsidiaries.
      Foster said certain Stearn officers and senior management
  made Stearn's operations appear more profitable than they were
  by improperly recording job costs. It said Stearn's president
  and controller had resigned. A Foster spokesman said he did not
  know the names of the president and controller, and could not
  immediately comment on the release.
      Foster said the amount involved in the ""discrepancy"" is
  about 13.7 mln dlrs before taxes or about 8.2 mln dlrs net
  after tax due to an ""improper recording of job costs over a
  period of several years and continuing through part of the
  first quarter of 1987.""
      Stearns is a unit of Foster's Conergic Corp subsidiary.
  The company said the impact on its results for 1987 was not
  ""likely to be significant"" but the amount to be charged to
  prior periods had not been determined.
      Foster reported after tax earnings of 28 mln dlrs, 26 mln
  dlrs and 35.4 mln dlrs for 1986, 1985, and 1984, respectively.
      Stearns, based in Crowley, Texas, makes airport baggage
  conveyor equipment and passenger loading bridges.
      Foster, a diversified international concern with 27
  subsidiaries operating worldwide, is based in Livingston, New
  Jersey. Its reported revenues for the period ended December 26,
  1986 of 1.3 billion dlrs.
      The company said a detailed audit and investigation is
  continuing. A company spokesman declined to comment further on
  the investigation.

test/14931,"POEHL WARNS AGAINST FURTHER DOLLAR FALL
  Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl
  said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation
  of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German
  economic growth.
      In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs
  here, Poehl said ""It would be an extremely risky policy to aim
  for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to
  correct the trade deficit.""
      He said the United States could face a vicious circle of
  depreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took that
  route.
      Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet
  U.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy,
  accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and tolerating
  above-target money supply growth.
      He said he would have been happy to have brought forward
  five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to
  the beginning of this year, but he said the government faced
  political constraints getting such measures through the upper
  house of the West German parliament.
      But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could
  accept on exports from a rising mark, he said.
      Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about
  one-third of its gross national product, so a substantial
  erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing
  demand at home.
      ""A further appreciation of the mark could even be an
  obstacle to further growth,"" he said.
      Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply
  growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and
  because external factors, including low oil prices and
  favourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway.
      But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma
  over monetary policy.
      The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not the
  reported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germany
  was affected more than before by exchange rate developments.
      ""For the time being, we will have to focus our policy more
  on the external side, and we can live with a more expansionary
  money supply. But we must be very careful,"" he said.
      He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan's
  trade surpluses, which affected European countries as well as
  the United States.
      Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary
  officials of major industrialized countries, saying the
  importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange
  rates had been underestimated.
      All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the
  right level, and that further changes would damage growth, he
  said.
      ""This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on the
  part of our American colleagues,"" he said.
      But he said there was still a danger that the correction of
  the dollar's value could overshoot.

  Taiwan announced plans for another round
  of import tariff cuts on 862 foreign goods shortly before trade
  talks with Washington which officials described as a move to
  help balance trade with the United States.
      Wang Der-Hwa, Deputy Director of the Finance Ministry's
  Customs Administration Department, told reporters the list of
  products included 60 items asked by Washington.
      ""The move is part of our government efforts to encourage
  imports from our trading partners, particularly from the United
  States,"" he said.
      He said the ministry sent a proposal today to the cabinet
  that the tariffs on such products as cosmetics, bicycles,
  apples, radios, garments, soybeans and television sets be cut
  by between five and 50 pct.
      The cabinet was expected to give its approval next Thursday
  and the new tariff cuts would be implemented possibly starting
  on April 20, he added.
      Taiwan introduced a sweeping tariff cut on some 1,700
  foreign products last January aimed at helping reduce its
  growing trade surplus with the United States, the island's
  largest trading partner.
      Washington however was not satisfied with the cuts and
  pressed for more reductions as a way of cutting its huge trade
  deficit with Taipei.
      Washington's deficit with Taipei rose to a record 13.6
  billion U.S. Dlrs last year from 10.2 billion in 1985. It
  widened to 3.61 billion in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.78
  billion a year earlier, Taiwan's official figures show.
      Today's announcement came before a departure later today of
  a 15-member Taiwan delegation for Washington for a series of
  trade talks with U.S. Officials.
      The delegation's leader, Vincent Siew, told reporters last
  night he was leaving with ""a heavy heart,"" meaning that he would
  face tough talks in Washington because of rising protectionist
  sentiments in the U.S. Congress. Taiwan's 1986 trade surplus
  with Washington was the third largest, after Japan and Canada.
      Siew said the talks, starting on April 14, would cover U.S.
  Calls for Taiwan to open its market to American products,
  purchases of major U.S. Machinery and power plant equipment,
  import tariff cuts and protection of intellectual property.
      ""I am afraid this time we have to give more than take from
  our talks with the U.S.,"" he said without elaborating.

  Citibank A/S &lt;CCI.N>, the Norwegian
  subsidiary of the U.S.-based bank, said it made a net loss of
  just over six mln crowns in 1986 -- although foreign bankers
  said they expect it to show 1987 profits after two lean years.
      Citibank's Oslo treasury head Bjoern Sejerstad told
  Reuters, Citibank, one of seven foreign bank subsidiaries
  operating in Norway, lost money because of restructuring for
  investment banking away from commercial banking and an economic
  slump in Norway following last year's plunge in oil prices.
      Foreign banks have been allowed to operate susbidiaries in
  Norway since 1985.
      Foreign banking analysts in Oslo said access to Norway's
  second-hand securities and equities markets, to be approved
  later this spring, and lower primary reserve requirements would
  make profit this year.
      Citibank lost 490,000 crowns in Norway in 1985, but
  Sejerstad said a profit was likely this year because of planned
  liberalisation and better economic performance, helped by a
  steadier oil price of around 18 dlrs a barrel.
      Earlier this year, Chase Manhattan Bank's &lt;CMB.N>
  subsidiary decided to stop foreign exchange trading after heavy
  losses and focus instead on fee-based merchant banking.

  China expects its 1987 grain harvest to be
  397 mln tonnes, eight mln tonnes short of its target, the New
  China News Agency quoted a State Statistical Bureau spokesman
  as saying.
      The harvest will be China's second highest in history but
  poor weather and low incentives for grain-producing farmers
  have kept yields down, earlier Chinese press reports said.
      Industry sources expect China to import at least 10 mln
  tonnes of grain this year because of the harvest shortfall.
      Chinese customs figures showed grain imports of 9.59 mln
  tonnes in the first eight months of 1987, compared with 6.09
  mln in the same 1986 period.
      Agriculture Minister He Kang said last month state prices
  for grain purchase from growers were to be adjusted to increase
  the incentive for grain production.
      China could not afford to become a major food importer, he
  said.
      The State Statistics Bureau spokesman also said China's
  1987 cotton output was expected to rise 10 pct over 1986 to 390
  mln tonnes.

  Proven oil and gas deposits in Saudi
  Arabia increased in 1986 despite higher oil output, according
  to the kingdom's main producing company, Aramco.
      Recoverable oil reserves in Aramco fields rose to 167
  billion barrels by the end the year from 166.5 billion in 1985,
  while gas reserves jumped by 7.7 pct to 135.8 trillion cu ft
  from 126.1 trillion, the company's annual report said.
      Aramco, responsible for all Saudi production except about
  200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the Neutral Zone between Saudi
  Arabia and Kuwait, increased production to 4.69 mln barrels per
  day in 1986 from 3.04 mln barrels a year earlier.
  
      Most of 1986 was a virtual free-for-all in production, as
  OPEC members abandoned restraint in an effort to recapture
  their share of the market. In the process, prices collapsed
  from about 28 dlrs a barrel to below nine dlrs, until the
  organisation decided to cut production again from last
  September onwards.
      Saudi output in 1985 had been the lowest since the 1960s.
      Production of natural gas liquids in 1986 declined slightly
  to 304,178 bpd from 316,310, said the report, carried on the
  official Saudi Press Agency.
      The increase in reserves came despite a sharp cut in the
  number of wells Aramco drilled to 33 in 1986 from 103 in 1985.
  
      Aramco's only refinery, at Ras Tannurah, processed 142.44
  mln barrels (390,246 bpd) of crude last year. The plant was
  upgraded to a capacity of 530,000 bpd during the year, enabling
  it to supply 50 pct of local demand for oil products, the
  report said.
      The country's other five, smaller refineries -- owned by
  another state-owned oil organisation, Petromin -- produced
  around 750,000 bpd last year.
  
      Sulphur production rose to 1.23 mln tonnes in 1986 from
  998,707 tonnes in 1985. During the year the company began
  operating a sulphur granule plant with capacity of 4,000 tonnes
  per day, the report said.
      Aramco said it awarded 1,303 contracts last year worth 1.4
  billion riyals -- about 370 mln dlrs.

  Publisher Robert Maxwell's British
  Printing and Communicaton Corp PLC said it filed a lawsuit in
  U.S. district court against Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc, its
  directors and advisers to stop, among other things, payment of
  the special dividend Harcourt is paying as part of its
  recapitalization.
      The suit, filed in Manhattan, also names First Boston Corp
  &lt;FBC> and seeks to void the issue by Harcourt of 40,000 shares
  of super voting preferred stock to First Boston Securities Corp
  and the issue of convertible voting preferred stock with
  4,700,000 votes in the Harcourt employee stock ownership plan.
      The preferred shares to be issued to First Boston have
  8,160,000 votes. The suit, brought derivatively on behalf of
  Harcourt and individually in British Printing's capacity as a
  substantial holder of Harcourt common shares and 6-3/8 pct
  convertible debentures.
      The suit alleges Harcourt's special dividend exceeds by
  more than one billion dlrs Harcout's surplus available for
  dividends under New York law and contstitutes a fraudulent
  conveyance.
      The lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt failed to disclose
  that one consequence of the payment of the dividend, which it
  terms illegal, will be that shareholders will be liable to
  repay it.
      Harcourt last week said it would pay 40 dlrs per share to
  stockholders as a special dividend. Harcourt also announced an
  extensive recapitalization plan, which analysts said was aimed
  at thwarting a takeover effort by British Printing.
      British Printing last week withdrew its 44 dlr per share,
  or two billion dlr offer for Harcourt because of the
  recapitalizaton plan. At the time, it said it was reviewing its
  alternatives.
      British Printing said it filed the suit after consultation
  with its advisers. Its lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt
  failed to disclose the effect of the special dividend on
  Harcourt 6-3/8 pct convertible debentures.
      British Printing alleges the effect will be an enormous
  increase effective on the June eight record date for the
  dividend in the number of Harcourt common shares issuable upon
  conversion of the debentures. British Printing also charged 
  Harcourt is unlawfully coercing debenture holders to convert
  denbentures before the record date because Harcourt may not
  have enough authorized common shares to honor conversion after
  the date.
      British Printing holds 460,600 shares and 5.6 mln dlrs
  worth of debentures.
      The suit also alleges that management, the board of
  directors, and First Boston engaged in an illegal scheme of
  entrenchment through a combination of selling to First Boston
  Securities Corp the super voting preferred at a bargain price,
  the grant to the company employee stock plan of convertible
  voting preferred, the six mln share open market repurchase
  program and the manner in which its financing has been
  structured.

test/16871,"U.S. COMMERCE TRADE REPORT OMITS FREIGHT COSTS
  The Commerce Department said on that
  insurance and freight costs for imported goods of 1.45 billion
  dlrs were included in the February trade deficit of 15.1
  billion dlrs reported on Tuesday.
      The department is required by law to wait 48 hours after
  the initial trade report to issue a second report on a ""customs
  value"" basis, which eliminates the freight and insurance
  charges from the cost of imports.
      Private-sector economists emphasized that the Commerce
  Department was not revising down the deficit by 1.45 billion
  dlrs but simply presenting the figures on a different basis.
      A report in the Washington Post caused a stir in the
  foreign exchanges today because it gave the impression, dealers
  said, that the underlying trade deficit for February had been
  revised downward.
      The Commerce department would like to have the law changed
  to permit it to report both sets of figures simultaneously.
      ""My feeling is the second one is a better report but there's
  legislation that requires us to delay it two days,"" said Robert
  Ortner, Commerce undersecretary for economic affairs.
      ""But this has been going on for a long time and no one pays
  any attention to the second figure.""
      The 15.1 billion dlr February trade deficit compared with a
  revised January deficit of 12.3 billion dlrs.
      The law requiring a 48-hour delay in publishing the monthly
  trade figure excluding freight and insurance was passed in
  1979.
      Reportedly the feeling was the first figure, which includes
  customs, freight and insurance, allowed a better comparison
  with other countries that reported their trade balances on the
  same basis.
      The second figure, which would always be lower by deducting
  freight and insurance, presents the deficit in a more favorable
  light for the Reagan administration.
      Ortner said he would like to see the law changed to
  eliminate the 48-hour delay in reporting the two figures.
      ""We're considering it,"" he said, ""It's one of those dinosaur
  laws and I think it's time has come.""

test/19721,"RAINS HELP U.S. WESTERN CORN BELT, MORE SEEN
  Weekend rain over the Western Corn Belt
  brought further relief to crop areas that had been dry earlier
  this month, and developing weather patterns will bring welcome
  moisture to central and eastern belt locations this week,
  according to Dale Mohler, senior meteorologist for Accu-Weather
  Inc.
      ""There is going to be more rain for the next two, three
  days,"" he said. ""We're in a fairly wet pattern with normal to
  above normal moisture this week.""
      Mohler said rainfall averaged 1/2 inch across southern
  Minnesota, 3/4 inch over southwest Iowa, one inch in eastern
  Nebraska and 1-1/2 inches in south-central Nebraska.
      Illinois fields saw virtually no rain over the weekend but
  were receiving scattered thundershower activity today, he said.
      Rain patterns will move across Indiana to Ohio with
  thudershower activity yielding to more general rains, he said.
      ""Tomorrow, that eastern area will get 1/4 to one inch, a
  pretty good rain,"" Mohler said.
      Rain was heavier than expected over the weekend, sparking
  an early selloff in soybean futures at the Chicago Board of
  Trade. Prices were off 14 to 20-1/2 cents with November off
  19-1/2 cents at 5.43-1/2 dlrs.
      Mohler said the cold front now over the eastern belt is
  expected to move over the central Midwest, then move north
  later in the week. That could bring new rain patterns across
  the Corn Belt and assure good crop conditions as
  early-developed corn moves into the crucial pollination stage
  in early July, he said.

test/15063,"ENERGY/U.S. PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY
  Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S.
  dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will
  propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record
  profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990,
  major company executives predicted.
      This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an
  industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF
  Corp &lt;GAF>, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms
  to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants.
      Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc &lt;ASH>, the
  Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for
  money-making petrochemical businesses to buy.
      ""I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period,"" said
  Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW>, adding,
  ""There's no major plant capacity being added around the world
  now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving
  the old ones.""
      Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers,
  automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of
  paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.
      U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about
  90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike
  product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher,
  managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand
  for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up
  by as much as 300 pct, he said.
      Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in
  Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned
  last year and predicted it would have the best year in its
  history.
      In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel
  and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S.
  dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. ""I believe the entire
  chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,""
  Oreffice said.
      GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical
  industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.
  Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion
  dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.
      The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical
  industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and
  planning, said Pace's John Dosher.
      Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocks
  dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar
  was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost
  U.S. chemical exports.
      Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has
  been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical
  manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers
  in the early 1980s.
      Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers
  have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program
  to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate
  unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of
  friendly and hostile takeover attempts.
      GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire
  Union Carbide Corp &lt;UK>, recently offered three billion dlrs
  for Borg Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics
  and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace &lt;GRA> 
  has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer
  businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.
      But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be
  headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on
  the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as
  ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that
  are custom-designed for a small group of buyers.
      ""Companies like DuPont &lt;DD> and Monsanto Co &lt;MTC> spent the
  past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity
  chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had
  deteriorated,"" Dosher said. ""But I think they will eventually
  kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche
  market."" Some top chemical executives share the concern.
      ""The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting
  carried away and repeating past mistakes,"" GAF's Heyman
  cautioned. ""The shift from commodity chemicals may be
  ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long.""
      Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the
  Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700
  mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.
      Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout
  of Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1
  billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants
  along the Texas Gulf Coast.
      The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that
  are the building blocks of specialty products.
      ""This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a
  glamorous, high-margin business,"" Cain said, adding that demand
  is expected to grow by about three pct annually.
      Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said
  chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for
  plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood
  and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical
  business could last as long as four or five years, provided the
  U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.

  Morgan Crucible Co Plc &lt;MGCR.L> said the

  significantly up on last year in all divisions.
      It said there were good opportunities for growth in both
  existing and recently acquired businesses as well as for growth
  by acquisition in related areas.
      It earlier announced a 6.1 mln stg rise in pre-tax profit
  to 24.8 mln stg for the year to December 28. Turnover rose to
  242.1 mln from 211.5 mln.
      Most of its companies performed well despite a slowdown in
  the U.S., U.K. And Australian economies in the first half.
      Currency fluctuations reduced pretax profit by around one
  mln stg, it noted.
      Morgan said although profits in the electronics sector
  improved to 1.0 mln stg from 100,000 stg previously, results
  were nonetheless disappointing.
      Sales were lower than expected, due mainly to delayed
  defence orders and cancellations. However, it said it had taken
  the necessary remedial action, obtained new business and was
  now proceeding with the delivery of major delayed orders.
      Morgan shares firmed two pence to 318p at 0905 GMT from

  The Reserve Bank of India, RBI,
  announced new rules to allow exporters of 25 products to use
  foreign exchange up to 10 pct of their firm's total annual
  export earnings for export promotion abroad.
      The move is designed by the government to improve India's
  trade deficit.
      Products eligible for the new Blanket Exchange Permit
  Scheme include tea bags, cigarettes, coffee, leather, various
  textiles, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, plastics, engineering and
  electronic goods, ready-made garments, processed food, sports
  goods, fabricated mica and consultancy services.
      The scheme replaces current rules which allow different
  amounts of foreign exchange to be used only when firms attain a
  minimum annual turnover prescribed for each product.
      RBI said under the new rule, 16 other products will
  qualify, on a discretionary basis, for overseas promotional
  spending of not more than two pct of the freight-on-board value
  of annual export earnings.
      These include oil cakes, cereals, raw cotton, raw and
  semi-processed leather, gems, castor and sandalwood oil,
  psyllium husks and seeds, opium and various mineral ores.
      RBI said exporters of products not covered by either of the
  two groups will be eligible to use up to five pct of their
  freight-on-board value of their annual export earnings.
      Industry sources said the new entitlements, considerably
  higher than the previous limits, are also more flexible because
  holders of new permits no longer need to frequently apply to
  RBI for release of foreign exchange for export purposes.

  Citicorp has extended its reach
  into the California market with Citicorp Savings' acquisition
  of 50 of Sears Roebuck's &lt;S> Sears Savings Bank branches,
  bringing its presences to 143 branches in 101 communities,
  CitiCorp Savings said.
      Thrift industry analysts said the move, approved by the
  Federal Reserve board today, is a plus for Citicorp and shows
  its serious intent to penetrate the California market.
      The acquisition mostly extends Citicorp's reach into
  Southern California, where 34 of the 50 branches are located.
  Citicorp Savings was predominantly in Northern California.
      ""This marks our first major expansion in California,
  particularly in the south,"" said Citicorp Savings President
  Edward Valencia, in a statement.
      Thrift industry sources said they do not see a major
  near-term impact on the Southern California thrift market, but
  do expect Citicorp to be a more aggressive competitor than
  Sears was in that market.
      ""We do believe they will be a better competitor than
  Sears,"" said James Stutz, Executive Vice President of Home
  Federal Savings and Loan Association &lt;HFD>, based in San Diego.
      Banking industry sources said the move is viewed as
  groundwork, to establish Citicorp throughout the California
  market, well before the 1991 law change that will allow it to
  operate as a bank in the state. They said Citicorp is likely to
  convert the branches to banks at that time.
      In the near-term, however, analysts said with seven billion
  dlrs in assets, Citicorp Savings is still not a major force in
  the thrift market, against such large California thrifts as
  Home Federal, Great Western Financial Corp &lt;GWF>, H F Ahmanson

test/19499,"FAR EAST TRADERS EXPECT 20 DLR OIL IN JANUARY
  OPEC's agreement to limit output to 16.6
  mln barrels per day (bpd) for the rest of the year should boost
  spot prices and enable the group to raise its official
  reference price to 20 dlrs a barrel in January from the current
  18 dlrs, Far East oil industry sources said.
      ""Fundamentally, the market situation is bullish and the
  official price will be 20 dlrs in January,"" a Japanese refiner
  said.
      The sources said that in spite of over-production by OPEC
  members such as Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and
  Qatar, demand should exceed supply by the fourth quarter.
      Spot oil prices surged on Friday in late U.S. Trading as
  the market anticipated an OPEC agreement on second-half 1987
  output. In early Tokyo trade, levels were firm at 17.30 dlrs
  for Mideast Dubai cargoes loading next month and 19.00 dlrs for
  U.K. Brent, traders said.
      They said they expect more foreign crudes to be sucked into
  the U.S. Market as the benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate
  (WTI) trades at around 20.30 dlrs.
      ""With WTI at 20, 21 or 22 dlrs, U.S. Refiners will import
  Mideast and Far East crudes and this will strengthen those
  grades further,"" said a Japanese oil trader.
      Some Tokyo traders were cautious about whether thU spot
  market has further upward potential in the short term, having
  risen strongly on the OPEC news on Friday.
      ""You could certainly argue that if New York rose on that
  basis, there's no reason for prices to go up again today,"" said
  one international oil trader in Tokyo.
      ""But I think if there's any sign of a dip, it will be bought
  back up again pretty quickly,"" he added.
      One oil industry analyst concurred, ""There is no reason to
  expect a weak market from now on."" He said he expected OPEC to
  raise prices to 20 dlrs when it meets on December 9.
      Oil sources said spot prices are unlikely to surge strongly
  in the next few months due to cheating by some OPEC members and
  the likelihood that Saudi Arabia will act as swing producer to
  maintain steady prices.
      Iraq is currently producing around two mln barrels per day
  compared to its second-half quota of 1.54 mln, they said. Its
  export capability will rise to 2.5 mln bpd when a new pipeline
  through Turkey, comes onstream in or around September.
      Qatar is said to be achieving sales of around 350,000 bpd,
  against its OPEC-assigned quota of 299,000, by discounting up
  to 20 cents a barrel from official prices, the sources said.
      Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also cheating
  on the OPEC agreement with over-production and effective price
  discounts through counter-purchases, industry sources said. But
  they mostly agreed that Saudi Arabia will unofficially act as
  swing producer, cutting production to compensate for higher
  output by other members or boosting output if spot prices rise
  too high too fast.
      Saudi Arabia has a floating oil stockpile of 40 to 50 mln
  barrels. ""Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability so the
  stockpile may be utilized to cool down the market if it rises
  too much,"" an oil industry analyst said.

  Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa
  said the Group of Seven (G-7) nations still support the Louvre
  Accord to stabilise currencies.
      He also told a news conference following a cabinet meeting
  that the Group of Five (G-5) and G-7 do not have any plans to
  meet for talks.
      The Finance Minister further said that overseas stock
  market plunges will not lead to a freefall in the Tokyo stock

  Tokyo,"" he added.
      Miyazawa said the Tokyo stock market should not be gravely
  affected by the downturns of markets in New York and London
  because there is a clear sign of an economic recovery in Japan
  and stability of exchange rates.
      Asked if the U.S. Had contacted Japan after the stock

test/18621,"OPEC DIFFERENTIALS NOT SEEN POSING MAJOR PROBLEMS
  Some OPEC states are unhappy about the
  prices assigned to their crude oil but this should not pose
  great problems when the group reviews its six-month-old price
  and output pact in Vienna next week, oil analysts say.
      They said Nigeria, which holds the OPEC conference
  presidency, and Qatar probably have the biggest grievances
  about price differentials making some of their crudes
  uncompetitive.
      There has also been speculation by Japanese traders that
  OPEC might want to mark up prices of high-sulphur heavy crudes,
  to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices.
      But most experts agree that a major overhaul of price
  differentials is unlikely, so as to avoid giving the market
  signals of a dent in OPEC's new unity.
      ""All OPEC members can make a good case for changing
  differentials,"" said one analyst with a major oil company. ""But
  at the end of the day, the attitude is going to be ""leave well
  alone' and little or nothing is likely to be altered.""
      Iran, Libya and Saudi Arabia are among those who also saw
  sales problems earlier this year, traders say. But diminished
  customer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases,
  marketing incentives have helped their sales.
      Some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by
  means of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongside
  better priced grades in a ""package.""
      Many OPEC crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at least
  for some part of the year. But many experts say OPEC should
  change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for
  fuel oil-rich heavy crudes and gasoline-rich lighter grades. At
  its last meeting in December, OPEC agreed to reintroduce fixed
  prices from February 1 around an 18 dlr per barrel reference
  point. Official prices had been effectively dropped in 1985
  when members offered discounts to attract customers.
      OPEC also decided to limit first-half 1987 output to 15.8
  mln bpd and proposed ceilings of 16.6 mln for the third quarter
  and 18.3 mln for the fourth. Analysts expect it will now extend
  or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months.
      Spot market and netback values for some crudes do not
  mirror official prices, but OPEC will probably keep the 18 dlr
  target and at most make minimal changes to differentials,
  analysts say.
      The 18 dlr figure is based on a basket of six OPEC and one
  non-OPEC crudes. OPEC assigned prices to its other key export
  crudes, with a 2.65 dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest.
  Extra heavy crudes were among those left out.
      Industry estimates vary on the proportion of OPEC oil
  exports actually sold at official prices. Several experts say
  only one-quarter to one-third of the total in fact sells at
  official prices, with some of the rest included in processing
  or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products.
      Problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year,
  when some producers' output fell due to customer reluctance to
  pay the new prices.
     Nigeria especially found its gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude
  -- now OPEC's highest priced grade at 18.92 dlrs a barrel --
  was uncompetitive on the spot market against Britain's Brent.
      In February and March, Nigeria's production shrank below
  its 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota. Spot prices have since revived,
  due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output has
  risen.
      Some experts feel Bonny Light is still overvalued and say
  its price should be cut by between 50 cts to one dlr a barrel.
      But Mehdi Varzi, chief oil analyst with London's Kleinwort
  Grieveson Securities, doubts Nigeria will actively push the
  differentials question in Vienna.
      ""It would not look good for OPEC unity if Nigeria, which
  holds the presidency, raised the issue,"" he said.

  U.S. warships attacked and destroyed

  this matter is now closed.""

  about 120 miles east of Bahrain in the central Gulf with fire
  at 0700 EDT, Weinberger said.
      ""We chose a platform used by the Iranians to interfere with
  and be a source of potential attack on convoys...,"" Weinberger
  said at a Pentagon briefing. 
      ""We know it has been used indeed, to not only launch small
  boat attacks on shipping but to fire on U.S. helicopters...
      ""It's removal will contribute significantly to the safety of
  U.S. forces in the future,"" Weinberger said of the U.S. Navy's
  operation to escort oil tankers through the Gulf.
      ""We do not seek further confrontation with Iran but we will
  be prepared to meet any escalation of military actions by Iran
  with stronger countermeasures,"" Weinberger said.
      He said the 20 to 30 Iranian personnel on the oil platform
  were given a 20-minute warning to abandon the platform.
      ""As far as we know they did abandon the site,"" he said.
      Weinberger was asked why the United States had chosen to
  attack an oil platform rather than Iranian Silkworm missile
  platforms blamed by Washington for Friday's attack.

test/16636,"TEXACO &lt;TX> SAYS SOME OIL FLOWS RE-ESTABLISHED
  Texaco Inc has re-established some key
  oil supply lines following yesterday's court filing for
  protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankrupcty code, said
  Elton Yates, Texaco's coordinator of worldwide operations.
      ""Several companies say they are willing to start trading,""
  Yates told Reuters in an interview.
      The company last week had stated that a number of domestic
  and international oil suppliers were demanding cash for oil
  shipments, and in some cases, had cut supplies altogether.
  Banks had also cut credit lines, it said in court filings.
      Manufacturers Hanover Corp &lt;MHC> and other banks told
  Texaco it would cut off a one billion dlr credit line, Texaco
  said in the court filing. Chase Manhattan Corp &lt;CMB> and J.P.
  Morgan Co's &lt;JPM> Morgan Guaranty Trust Co asked for deposits
  to cover transactions, it said.
      The severe conditions with suppliers and creditors arose
  from an unfavorable ruling last Monday by the U.S. Supreme
  Court in Texaco's ongoing dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL> over
  the acquisition of Getty Oil Co in 1984.
      The High Court said Texas Courts must consider Texaco's
  plea to cut its 10.3 billion dlr bond while appealing the case.
      ""Most of the suppliers stayed with us as long as they
  could,"" Elton said. But following Monday's Supreme Court
  ruling, Texaco's suppliers began demanding cash and halting
  supplies.
      ""It wasn't until last Wednesday that it turned into an
  avalanche,"" he said. ""Supplies were cut to the point where we
  could not run the system at anywhere near capacity.""
      He said less than half of Texaco's oil supplies had been in
  jeapordy, but the cut off would have produced severe shortages
  by mid-May. Now the situation appears much less severe, Elton
  said.
      It said that Sonatrach, the Algerian national oil company,
  canceled future deliveries of crude oil and natural gas,
  Occidental Petroleum Co &lt;OXY> demanded cash for crude, and
  Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC> asked for special safeguards.
      The company also said British Petroleum Co PLC &lt;BP> last
  week refused to accept an order for fuel oil. But Yates today
  said, ""a big U.K. company has in fact said they would go on
  supplying. They had cancelled last week.""
      He declined to identify the company.
      &lt;Petroleos de Venezuela S.A.>, the Venezuelan state oil
  company that supplies a large portion of Texaco's oil, also
  halted shipments two weeks ago, Yates said.
      But he added that Texaco expected to meet with the
  Venezuelans later today in an attempt to reestablish that key
  supply line. Talks were also expected to take place with the
  Algerians, he added.
      Bankruptcy specialists said it was likely Texaco's chapter
  11 filing would allow the company to secure its credit lines
  and oil supplies that are key to the company's business.
      ""It will be business as usual for Texaco,"" said Martin
  Klein, a bankruptcy attorney at the New York law firm Dreyer
  and Traub.
      ""Creditors are a nervous bunch of people,"" he said. ""But
  when the dust settles they will reevaluate the situation and
  will likely extend credit to the chapter 11 company.""
      But other officials at Texaco were not immediately
  available to say whether discussions were being held with its
  banks, or whether credit lines had been reestablished.

  Venezuela's cabinet approved a new
  exchange rate for oil and mining export earnings, setting it at
  14.50 bolivars to the dollar from 7.50 bolivars previously,
  Minister Manuel Azpur UA said.
      Azpur told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the
  measure is ""fundamental to conserving the economic and financial
  strength of the petroleum industry.""
       He said the new exchange rate, which goes before the
  central bank for final approval tommorrow, will allow the state
  oil company Petroleos De Venezuela, S.A.(PDVSA) to solve its
  problem of working capital and implement investment plans,
  estimated at 20 billion bolivars for 1987. He did not say when
  the measure would become effective.
     Venezuela's oil industry previously sold its dollar earnings
  to the government at 7.50 to the dollar but bought foreign
  exchange from its imports at 14.50 bolivars.
     The new exchange rate will promote purchases of domestic
  goods and services by the industry, Azpur said. He added that
  it would also put PDVSA in a position to purchase more
  government debt bonds.                        
      PDVSA had available liquid assets of 20 billion bolivars at
  the start of this year, of which nine billion were in a trust
  fund in the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) and placed in
  government bonds.
    According to a contract between PDVSA and the central bank,
  the BCV must provide cash as the oil industry requries by
  repurchasing the bonds.
      PDVSA's contribution to the treasury last year was 44.480
  billion bolivars. It foreign earnings for oil and petrochemcial
  sales were 8.023 billion dlrs.

  The acting governor of Saudi Arabia's
  state-owned oil company, Petromin, Jamal Hassan Jawa, has
  retired at his own request, oil industry sources said.
      They said Ali Ibrahim Rubaishi, head of organisation
  planning in Petromin, would take over as acting governor.
      Jawa held the post since his predecessor, Abdul-Hadi Taher,
  left in a major oil industry shake up last December.
      The sources said Rubaishi had not been expected to hold the
  post permanently.
      The government removed Taher and Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki
  Yamani from their posts late last year in a move which industry
  sources said was aimed at coming to grips with a buyers' oil
  market.
      The two men had run the Saudi oil industry for more than 20
  years. Industry sources said that despite huge resources, Saudi
  Arabia had been unable to mould an oil marketing strategy tuned
  to the competitive realities of the 1980s glut.
      Hisham Nazer, who replaced Yamani, successfully led an
  OPEC-engineered return to fixed oil prices of 18 dlrs a barrel
  last December.
      Nazer is believed to be reviewing Saudi oil operations
  which could lead to a thorough overhaul in the way Saudi Arabia
  does business, the sources said.
      The sources had said possible candidates for the governor's
  job include Prince Abdul Aziz Ibn Salman Ibn Abdul Aziz, who
  earlier ran a research center at Saudi Arabia's University of
  Petroleum and Minerals, and former Deputy Planning Minister
  Faisal Beshir. They also list Abdulla Bakr, President of the
  University of Petroleum and Minerals, economist Ali Jonahi,
  Ahmed Shinawi, and Zuheir Masoud, director of Jeddah Islamic

  Current prospects for this year's

      The report said the assessment was based on travel in the

      It said crop conditions were better than earlier expected
  following the extreme dry conditions last fall and the
  prolonged winter temperatures this spring.
      However, in general plant development was at least three
  weeks or more behind normal this spring, and conditions varied
  greatly by regions, the report said.
      Fields seeded during the optimum period last fall, and
  especially those receiving supplemental irrigation water (about
  65 pct of the fields observed), appeared to be in good
  condition, with little evidence of winterkill, while others
  varied considerably, the report said.
      Fields lacking adequate moisture last fall showed weak and
  uneven stands. Spotty germination and winterkill in those
  fields averaged 10 to 30 pct, it said.

test/18148,"SHULTZ WELCOMES TOKYO ECONOMIC PACKAGE
  U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said
  the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by Tokyo last
  week went further than the U.S. Had expected.
      But he said the U.S. Would not lift the selective economic
  sanctions it imposed on Japanese imports in April until Tokyo
  changed its sales policies concerning computer microchips.
      Speaking in a televised news conference linking several
  European capitals, Shultz said it was heartening that the
  Japanese had confronted the problem of stimulating domestic and
  global demand.
  
      ""There is an even greater amount of stimulus than was
  originally thought,"" said Shultz, speaking from Washington.
      ""It is a lot more than nothing. It is more than was talked
  about when (Prime Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone was here.
      ""It involves a major reduction in tax rates and we believe
  that getting the tax burden down is one way of stimulating the
  economy,"" he added.
      But asked by Japanese reporters, also linked into the news
  conference, whether the positive reaction meant the U.S. Might
  decide at next week's Venice summit to lift its sanctions on
  some Japanese electronic goods, Shultz replied:
      ""These sanctions were undertaken on the basis of an
  agreement that had been reached between the United States and
  Japan on various sale practices and prices relating to the chip
  market.
      ""They will be lifted as the facts of change by Japan to the
  agreement that it made become evident.""
      He said U.S. Officials had only been able to monitor the
  situation for a month and that it was impossible to determine a
  trend on only one month's data.
      The U.S. Imposed 100 pct import duties on personal
  computers, colour televisions and power tools, alleging that
  Japan had violated last September's bilateral agreement by
  selling computer chips at below fair market value.
      Shultz said West Germany and other nations would also do
  well to look at what they could do to stimulate demand.
      Asked whether the U.S. Could reasonably ask its allies to
  take action to stimulate the world economy without a bold
  American initiative to reduce the size of the federal budget
  deficit, Shultz said moves were already underway to tackle the
  problem.
      He said by the end of the current fiscal year the deficit
  would probably be reduced by around 35 billion dlrs against
  last year, and that the budget being worked on this year would
  contain a major reduction.

  Robert Fildes, president and chief

  is not interested in buying Cetus.
      Earlier the companies said Squibb would buy from Cetus a
  five pct equity postion in Cetus for about 40 mln dlrs.
      ""This is not an attempt by Squibb to become a major
  majority holder in Cetus,"" Fildes told Reuters in an interview.
  ""Squibb has not approached us with any indication that they
  want to acquire us and we wouldn't be interested in that kind
  of arrangement,"" said Fildes.
      Squibb could not be reached to comment on the late comments
  by Fildes.
      Squibb is Cetus' first pharmaceutical partner and the only
  one to own an equity position in Cetus. Eastman Kodak Co &lt;EK>
  and W.R. Grace &lt;WR> both have joint ventures with Cetus, but
  neither owns an equity position in the company, said Fildes.
      Cetus has a venture with Kodak to develp diagnostic
  products and with Grace to develop agricultural products.
      Earlier, Squibb and Cetus announced in a joint statement 
  an agreement in principle to form a joint venture to develop
  new biotechnology products in several fields.
     
      As part of the deal Squibb will license several of Cetus'
  anticancer agents, including interleukin-2, in development.
  Squibb will sell the drugs only in Japan and other markets but
  not in North American and Western Europe.
      ""We wouldn't have done this deal had it not been understood
  that Cetus wants to build its own fully integrated business in
  North America and Europe,"" said Fildes.
      He said Squibb was the good partner because Squibb has a
  major joint venture in Japan and has sales capabilities of its
  own in that market.
     
      Fildes said Cetus has shunned licensing arrangements with
  pharmaceutical companies because it wanted to build its own
  business. Many large corporations have invested in small
  biotech firms.
      But Squibb's investment in Cetus is the first it has made
  in biotechnology. Fildes said that was attractive to Cetus
  because it wanted a partner that didn't have a relationship
  with a large number of other biotechnology companies.""
     
      Fildes said his strategy was to have partners in non drug
  areas like diagnostics and agriculture, but to ""keep the
  biggest developments in anticancer drugs to ourselves.""
      Fildes said the partnership with Squibb would be used to
  broaden the company's reach in such big money making areas
  as the cardiovascular, anti-infective and the anti-inflammatory
  markets.
      Squibb is also investming 75 mln dlrs in Cetus' research
  over the next five years.
     
      ""Squibb is putting up over 75 mln dlrs in research and
  development to make it happen, while the equity position part
  of the package is simply to demonstrate the seriousness of this
  partnership,"" said Fildes.

  National Westminster Bank USA said
  higher loans and core deposit volumes as well as a substantial
  increase in net interest income contributed to a 16 pct rise in
  first-quarter earnings to 17.7 mln dlrs from 15.3 mln reported
  a year earlier.
      The earnings gain came despite a 1.5 mln dlr reduction of
  income as a result of placing Brazilian loans on non-accrual.
      Net interest income totalled 92.5 mln dlrs compared with
  91.7 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period as loans, mostly to
  middle market businesses, increased by 896 mln dlrs. But some
  of these gains were offset by low levels of interest rates.
      Provision for loan losses rose to 13.8 mln dlrs from 13.0
  mln a year earlier. At March 31, the allowance for loan losses
  was 114.2 mln dlrs versus 94.8 mln at end of March 1986.
      Non-accrual loans rose to 286 mln dlrs from 132 mln at the
  end of the first quarter of 1986, largely because 119 mln dlrs
  of loans to Brazil were put on non-accrual status.
      The bank said that if these loans remain on non-accrual for
  the remainder of the year net income for 1987 would be reduced
  by about 4.9 mln dlrs.

test/18328,"U.S. HOUSE PASSES GULF BILL DESPITE OPPOSITION
  The U.S. House of Representatives 
  approved a bill that requires the Reagan administration to
  provide Congress with a report on its Gulf policy but does not
  place any restrictions on its actions.
      The bill passed 305-102 -- winning a necessary two-thirds
  of those voting -- despite a last-minute revolt by an alliance
  of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans who sought to
  defeat it as a signal that a growing number of legislators
  oppose President Reagan's policies in the region.
      The legislation was passed in the wake of the May 17th
  Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf,
  which killed 37 Americans, and Reagan's decision to protect 11
  Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags --
  effectively making them American ships.
      The legislation -- supported by Congress' Democratic and
  Republican leadership as well as by the administration --
  required Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger to provide a
  report to Congress, within seven days of enactment, on plans to
  protect U.S. warships and flag ships in the Persian Gulf.
      It did not, however, place any restrictions on the
  administration as it proceeds to reflag the Kuwaiti ships and
  thus has no immediate effect on U.S. policy.
      The Senate was expected to approve the legislation this
  week. The bill would then be sent to Reagan for signature.
      Supporters of the bill said passage of the bill was only a
  first step toward a greater congressional involvement in
  formulating policy.
      But Democratic critics said the bill did not ask the
  administration to address tough policy questions in the report.

  at last week's pact from 3.60 on the last fixed-rate tender in
  late September.
      The Bundesbank's reduction of the key allocation rate to
  3.80 from 3.85 pct was heralded Monday by repeated injections
  of money market liquidity at between 3.70 and 3.80 pct.
      These moves to cap interest rates followed a meeting
  between Poehl, Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.
  Treasury Secretary James Baker Monday in Frankfurt.
      Officials said afterwards the three men had reaffirmed
  their commitment to the Louvre accord on currency stability.
      Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of the tightening in
  West German monetary policy had prompted a sharp fall of the
  dollar on speculation that Louvre cooperation had ended.
      But the dollar rallied on news of Monday's meeting in
  nervous trading to trade above 1.79 marks Tuesday.
      Poehl said that the recent rise in interest rates was not
  due to central bank policy, but to markets' expectations, and
  currency developments.
      Commenting on the inflationary expectations, Poehl said ""You
  have to get to the root of the problem, you have to pursue a
  policy which reveals that there are no grounds for such fears.""
   The inflationary fears were unjustified and exaggerated, he
  said.
      Poehl rebuffed recent U.S. Criticism of West Germany,
  saying the Bundesbank had made a substantial contribution to
  international cooperation in interest and monetary policy.
      The Bundesbank has tolerated an overshooting of its money
  supply target, arousing criticism from other quarters, he said.
      ""Today we still have lower interest rates than at the end of
  1986... Quite the contrary of other countries, where interest
  rates have risen substantially more,"" Poehl said.
      This had to be taken into account when considering recent
  rises in repurchase pact allocation rates, which were due to
  rising international money market rates that had spilled over
  into the German market, he said.
      Poehl expressed surprise that financial markets had so far
  ignored improvements in the U.S. Deficits.
      ""The adjustment process in the U.S. Trade balance is
  definitely underway,"" he said, noting that this was not so
  noticeable in absolute figures.
      The spectacular improvement in the budget deficit had also
  attracted little attention, he said.

  The Zambian government today announced
  minor price cuts for essential commodities as part of its new
  economic strategy, while police and troops patrolled the
  northern Copperbelt to prevent any outbreaks of rioting.
      However, staple foods, such as bread, sugar and maize meal,
  were not affected by the cuts and many people said this could
  provoke trouble from disgruntled elements who had expected more
  sweeping reductions.
      Observers in the capital expressed disillusionment with the
  small extent of the price cuts, which ranged up to 10 pct on
  items such as blankets, soap, detergents and baby food.
      Residents in the Copperbelt contacted by telephone said
  government forces had set up roadblocks around the main towns.
      In Lusaka, business went on as usual and there was no sign
  of troops or police reinforcements on the streets.
      President Kaunda had ordered the price reductions to take
  account of lower import costs following the revaluation of the
  kwacha to a fixed rate of eight per dlr from 21 on May 1.
      The revaluation formed part of a new go-it-alone economic
  strategy which Kaunda adopted to replace Zambia's IMF austerity
  program.
      Labour leaders in the Copperbelt said last week gangs of
  unemployed youths were being formed in the politically volatile
  region to take action against shops that did not reduce their
  prices after today's deadline. Fifteen people were killed in
  the Copperbelt during food riots last December after the
  government tried to lift maize subsidies.

  The Soviets have not indicated an
  urgent need for a U.S. wheat subsidy offer, and it is unlikely
  that such an offer will be ma during the U.S./Soviet summit
  expected to be held next month, Agriculture Secretary Richard
  Lyng told Reuters.
      In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Lyng said he did
  not know if the United States will offer Moscow another wheat
  subsidy offer this year or when that offer will be made.
      ""Last year it was well into the year before we offered it.
  There's been nothing that's taken place to indicate to me that
  there's a pressing need on their part for that sort of deal (a
  wheat subsidy).""
      When asked if a subsidy would be offered at a U.S./Soviet
  summit, Lyng said, ""No, I don't think so. I don't think that.""
      The Agriculture Secretary said a U.S. wheat subsidy deal to
  Moscow would not be the kind of topic appropriate for
  discussion at a summit.
      ""It would not be the kind of issue that the President or the
  Chairman would get into specific negotiations or discussions
  about,"" Lyng said.
      ""When Mr. Nikonov (communist party secretary for
  agriculture) was here ... he indicated that trade in wheat was
  not something that would be discussed with the President of the
  United States. He said it's not presidential,"" Lyng said.
      Lyng said uncertainties about wheat quality in some major
  producing areas of the world, volatile wheat prices and the
  still unfinished Soviet grain harvest could delay any final
  decision on the timing of another wheat subsidy to Moscow.
      The future of the U.S./Soviet long-term grains agreement
  will be discussed the first of next year, Lyng said, but the
  Agriculture Secretary questioned the benefits of the
  long-standing agreement.
      ""We've had three years in a row in which the Soviets have
  failed to live up to their end of the agreement ... We would
  love to continue to keep doing busines with the Soviet Union,
  but do we need a long-term agreement. Who benefits from that.
  These are some of the questions we need to discuss.""
      When asked if he felt the United States has benefitted from
  the agreement, Lyng said, ""I don't know. It certainly hasn't
  been what we had hoped it would be. For three years running
  they've (Moscow) failed to live up to what we considered was an
  agreement.""

  The U.S. Agriculture Department is
  seeking public comments on the question of adjusting the
  Commodity Credit Corporation's (CCC) discount and premium
  schedules to improve the quality of grain it accepts as loan
  collateral or under price support programs.
      The premiums and discounts schedule are based on quality
  factors such as moisture content and kernel damage. The
  schedule stipulates the premiums and discounts used for valuing
  grain the CCC accepts or purchases during the year.
      The department said it is possible that producers could be
  encouraged to delivery higher quality grain to CCC by adjusting
  the premiums and discounts.
      Comments are due by April 24 and a report to Congress is

test/19028,"FED DATA SUGGEST NO CHANGE IN MONETARY POLICY
  New U.S. Banking data suggest the
  Federal Reserve is guiding monetary policy along a steady path
  and is not signalling any imminent change of course, economists
  said.
      But they also said that if money supply growth remains
  weak, as this week's unexpected eight billion dlr M-1 decline
  suggests it may, this could influence the Fed to loosen its
  credit reins and move toward a more accommodative monetary
  policy.
      A Reuter survey of 17 money market economists produced a
  forecast of a 600 mln dlr M-1 decline for the week ended June
  8, with estimates ranging from a gain of one billion dlrs to a
  decline of four billion. Instead, M-1 fell eight billion dlrs
  to 745.7 billion dlrs at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.
      Coming on the heels of a 4.3 billion decrease in M-1 for
  the week ended June 1, this means the nation's money supply has
  fallen more than 12 billion dlrs in the past two weeks,
  economists said.
      ""M-1 has hit an air pocket of weakness,"" said Bill Sullivan
  of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
      While M-1 may have lost its significance as an indicator of
  economic growth, Sullivan said Fed officials might be concerned
  the latest drop in M-1 means another month of sluggish growth
  in the broader monetary aggregates, M-2 and M-3, which are seen
  as better gauges of economic growth.
      Latest monthly M-2 and M-3 data showed that as of May, both
  measures were growing at rates below the bottom of the Fed's
  5-1/2 to 8-1/2 pct target ranges.
      If money growth does not accelerate, Fed officials,
  concerned that this indicates economic growth is flagging,
  could turn toward easier monetary policy, economists said.
      ""Does this mean that the Fed abandons its current open
  market position? No,"" Sullivan said. ""But does this mean the end
  of tightening for the time being? Definitely yes.""
      Economists said average adjusted discount window borrowings
  of 385 mln dlrs for the latest two-week bank statement period
  were lower than they had expected. Most believed the Fed had
  targetted a two-week borrowings average of around 500 mln dlrs.
      But they said that if it had not been for a large one-day
  net miss in the Fed's reserve projections, the higher
  borrowings target would probably have been reached.
      A drop in May U.S. Housing starts and continued weakness in
  auto sales show key sectors of the U.S. Economy are lagging,
  while a recent modest 0.3 pct gain in May producer prices has
  helped dispel inflation fears, Slifer said.
      ""If this continues, we can entertain the notion of Fed
  easing at some point,"" he said.
      Other economists said the Fed would probably pay little
  attention to weak money supply growth. ""It has been a number of
  years since M-1 has given good signs of what's going on in the
  economy,"" one said. ""I don't think M-1 shows that the economy is
  falling apart and the Fed should ease.""
      Economists agreed a stable dollar will continue to be a
  prerequisite for any move by the Fed toward easier monetary
  policy.
      They said the Fed is reluctant to lower short-term rates
  for fear this would spur expectations of a weaker dollar and
  higher inflation which would push up long-term yields and choke
  off econmomic growth.
      But Sullivan said the dollar has been steady since late
  April. ""The Fed has to determine if this represents a
  fundamental change for the dollar. If it does, then this gives
  them more room to ease,"" he said.

  The Justice Department said it asked
  the government to proceed cautiously on a plan allowing the
  nation's two largest intercity bus companies to merge their
  operations, a move one of the firms said may derail the deal.
      Justice's opposition to quick federal approval of a bid by
  Greyhound Lines Inc to take immediate control Trailways Corp
  prompted Greyhound to threaten -- in a brief filed with the
  Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) -- to drop the merger
  plan.
      Greyhound officials told Reuters late today the company
  hoped for ICC action on the merger by tomorrow.
      ""Greyhound Lines will go forward with the transaction only
  if it is permitted to assume immediate, unconditional control
  of Trailways' operations and to integrate them with its
  operations,"" Greyhound said in a filing with the ICC, the
  federal regulatory agency which has the final say over mergers
  of interstate bus companies.
      But Justice had said in an earlier filing with the ICC that
  it wanted the agency to move slowly on the plan and to turn
  down Greyhound's request to begin operating Trailways
  immediately.
      ""The department has just begun to receive relevant
  information on Trailways' financial condition and is in the
  process of assessing the correctness of the company's
  allegations,"" acting Assistant Attorney General Charles Rule
  said in comments submitted to the ICC.
      Greyhound announced June 19 that it wanted the ICC to let
  it begin operating Trailways immediately while continuing to
  evaluate the merger for possible antitrust problems.
      Greyhound said it would pay 80 mln dlrs for many of
  Trailways' terminals, buses and garages.
      The two companies said in papers filed with the ICC that
  Trailways ""could collapse in a matter of days.""
      They said Trailways owed suppliers more than six mln dlrs,
  with another six mln dlrs due June 30.
      The suppliers, they said, could force Trailways into
  bankruptcy ""at any time.""
      Trailways also owes a consortium of banks 76 mln dlrs, and
  the consortium has threatened to call the loan if Trailways
  fails to pay the interest due June 30, they said.

  National Distillers and Chemical Corp
  expects to realize a second quarter after-tax gain of four dlrs
  per share from the 545 mln dlr sale of its spirits business to
  American Brands Inc &lt;AMB>.
      National Distillers' stock rose 1-1/8 to 65-1/2, after an
  opening delay on the New York Stock exchange for an imbalance
  of orders.
      ""I think the sales price was higher than most people
  expected,"" said John Henry of E.F. Hutton Group.
      A company spokeswoman said the four dlr per share gain will
  be included in second quarter net, which compares with 31 cts
  per share last year, including the spirits and wine business
      ""They netted over 700 mln dlrs for spirits and wine. That
  will ease their interest cost burden,"" said Henry.
      National Distillers sold its wine business last month to
  Grand Metropolitan PLC's Heublein Inc for 128 mln dlrs.
      Henry said he had anticipated National Distillers would net
  only 600 mln dlrs at the most from the sale of the two liquor
  businesses.
      Henry said the company recovered from the sales the cost of
  buying Enron Chemicals in the fourth quarter last year.
  National Distillers paid 570 mln dlrs cash for Enron and
  assumed 34 mln dlrs in debt. National Distillers said at the
  time it bought Enron it would sell the spirits and wine
  businesses, moving more into the chemical area.
      For 1986, two thirds of income were from chemicals and
  propane. National Distillers earned, excluding the liquor
  businesses, 2.21 dlrs per share for 1986. Income from
  discontinued operations, including the liquor businesses, was
  67 cts per share.

  A quickly growing Texas-based
  distributor of electronics products offered 240 mln dlrs
  for Crazy Eddie Inc &lt;crzy>, the leading New York City
  electronics retailer, or one dlr per share more than its
  founder has bid.
      The 8-dlr-a-share offer by Entertainment Marketing Inc &lt;em>
  for Crazy Eddie comes less than two weeks after founder Eddie
  Antar and a firm controlled by the Belzbergs of Canada
  announced a bid to take the 32-store Crazy Eddie chain private.
      Analysts said Entertainment Marketing, whose revenues and
  profits quadrupled in 1986, may be looking to break into the
  highly competitive New York City retail market for consumer
  electronics, the nation's biggest, at a time the fortunes of
  electronics retailers have sagged.
      The analysts questioned whether Houston-based Entertainment
  Marketing, founded by a former electronics retailer but whose
  present buinesses are primarily as wholesale distributors, had
  the management expertise for retailing or was merely trying to
  drive up the price of the Crazy Eddie shares it already owns.
      ""I have mixed feelings,"" said analyst Dennis Telzrow of
  Eppler, Geurin and Turner, a Dallas brokerage. ""On the one hand
  it's probably a cheap price. On the other hand, does
  Entertainment Marketing have the management talent to run it
  and will the Crazy Eddie people leave?""
      ""It's a risky strategy for Entertainment Marketing,"" said
  analyst Eliot Laurence of Wessels Arnold and Henderson, a
  Minneapolis brokerage. ""Electronics retailing is very management
  concentrated; they'd want to keep Crazy Eddie's management in
  place.""
      Laurence said that, since Entertainment Marketing already
  owns 4.3 percent of Crazy Eddie's 31.3 million shares, it may
  be trying to get the Antar-Belzberg group to increase its
  7-dlr-a-share offer.
      Shares of Crazy Eddie, which have jumped from the high
  4-dlr range to above 7 dlrs since the Antar-Belzberg bid was
  announced May 20, rose another 50 cents Monday to 8.375 a share
  in over-the- counter trading. 
      Antar, the reclusive founder of the chain in the New York
  City, Philadelphia and Connecticut areas, said last month that
  his group controlled 14 percent of Crazy Eddie's shares.
      A Crazy Eddie spokesman said the company's board has taken
  no decision on the Antar-Belzberg offer, worth some 187 mln dlrs
  since they own more shares than Entertainment Marketing. He
  would not comment on the new offer.
      Entertainment Marketing sells computer products such as
  disk drives and other, often discounted electronics goods to
  retailers, primarily in the southwest, and directly to
  consumers by cable television.
      In fiscal 1986, ending last January, its revenues rose to
  87.9 mln dlrs from 21.3 mln dlrs the previous year. Net profit
  went to 3.2 mln dlrs from 750,000 dlrs in 1985.
      Entertainment Marketing, whose chief executive officer,
  Elias Zinn, once ran an electronics retailing business, said in
  a statement it had committed 50 mln dlrs toward the purchase
  of Crazy Eddie and had retained Dean Witter Reynolds Inc to
  assist in financing the balance.
      Analyst Telzerow estimated that the company would have to
  borrow about 100 mln dlrs to complete the proposed buyout since
  Crazy Eddie has cash and other assets worth about the same
  amount.
      Shares of Entertainment Marketing were up 12.5 cents Monday
  to 9.50.

  Mead Corp said the outlook for its

      ""The generally strong outlook bodes well for significantly
  improved earnings this year,"" Burnell Roberts, chairman and
  chief executive officer said.
      Earlier, the company reported first quarter earnings of
  34.2 mln dlrs, or 1.09 dlrs a share, versus 20.3 mln dlrs, or
  65 cts a share, in last year's first quarter.
      In 1986 the company reported earnings from continuing
  operations of 109.3 mln dlrs, or 3.50 dlrs a share.
      Mead said its first quarter benefitted from stronger market
  conditions and improved operations.
      ""The combination of capital improvement programs and more
  employee involvement has been paying off throughout our paper
  operations,"" Roberts said.
      He added that Mead's pulp and paperboard businesses are
  operating well as prices have improved and strong demand has
  placed most products in a sold-out position through the middle
  of the year.
      Mead said sales of its unbleached coated paperboard was

test/20632,"US RULED OUT ATTACK ON IRANIAN SILKWORMS
  U.S. military planners ruled out
  Iran's Silkworm missiles as a target in the retaliatory attack
  mounted on Monday for fear of being drawn more deeply into the
  Iran-Iraq war, defense and Middle East experts said.
      U.S. naval forces destroyed an offshore oil platform and
  raided another in what the administration called a ""measured and
  appropriate response"" to an Iranian Silkworm missile attack last
  Friday on a U.S.-flagged tanker in Kuwaiti waters.
      Private analysts generally agreed that going after the rig
  rather than an onshore economic or military target such as
  Silkworm launch sites reflected a careful bid by Washington to
  limit the political, military and diplomatic fallout both at
  home and in the Gulf.
      ""It simply demonstrated the United States will take military
  action when they (Iran) take military action,"" Norman Polmar, a
  defense analyst and author, said.
      He said hitting the platforms had spared Iran the
  embarrassment of casualties on its own soil, possibly avoiding
  an escalating spiral of attack and counterattack.
      In addition, it minimized the risk to U.S. forces and the
  potential embarrassment of any losses, including aircraft that
  could have been shot down had they taken part in an attack.
      Anthony Cordesman, author of a new book on the Iran-Iraq
  war, said the United States apparently chose a limited target
  to keep alive the possibility that U.N. Secretary General
  Javier Perez de Cuellar might still persuade Iran to accept a
  Security Council call for a ceasefire.
      ""We want the U.N. peace initiative to work if there's any
  chance at all,"" he said, adding that the action made it clear
  tougher steps would follow if Iran to attack Gulf shipping.
  
     In targeting an oil rig -- albeit one said by the Pentagon
  to have been turned into a military command post -- Washington
  also sent a message that it might be willing to attack Iran's
  economic lifeline. Pentagon officials said the platform had
  been used as a base for Iranian raids against shipping in the
  lower Gulf.
      ""We have chosen a military target, but we also have shown
  Iran that we are willing to interfere with its oil-exporting
  capabilities,"" Cordesman said.
      He predicted the United States would respond to any future
  major Iranian challenges by hitting Iran's naval base at Bandar
  Abbas on the Straits of Hormuz, followed by mining the
  approaches to Iran's oil export terminal on Kharg Island.
      Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger said on Monday the
  United States did not seek further confrontation with Iran, ""but
  we will be prepared to meet any escalation of military action
  by Iran with stronger countermeasures.""

  cash and 3.33 dlrs in liquidation value of cumulative
  redeemable preferred stock for each common share, the company
  said.
      Under the Bilzerian proposal, the dividend rate on the

  the financial advisor to Bilzerian and the financial advisor to
  Pay 'N Pak, the preferred stock would trade at its liquidation

  Clevite Industries Inc, which

  Industries Inc &lt;JPI>, said it amended its Shareholder Rights
  Plan so that certain provisions of the plan cannot occur until
  the board determines that it is in the best interests of the
  company and stockholders.
      The plan, adopted in December 1986, permits Clevite to
  issue shares at half price to existing stockholders and allows
  stockholders to buy shares of an unfriendly bidder at half
  price.
      Clevite said the amendments by its board effectively mean
  that the so-called flip-in and flip-over provisions of its
  rights plan can only be triggered by affirmative board
  approval.
      The company said it acted inview of the proposed

  Ecuador will use a new pipeline link
  with Colombia to export crude oil for the next five years,
  Colombian mines and energy minister Guillermo Perry said.
      The link will be inaugurated on May 8. It was built to
  allow Ecuador to resume exports of crude oil halted on March 5
  by earthquake damage to its Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline,
      Once that pipeline is repaired, Ecuador will exceed its
  OPEC quota in order to offset lost income and pay debts
  contracted with Venezuela and Nigeria since the quake, Ecuador
  mines and energy minister Javier Espinosa said.
      The two ministers were speaking at a news conference after
  signing an agreement for joint oil exploration and exploitation
  of the jungle border zone between the two nations. Drilling
  will begin in September.
      ""The agreement to transport Ecuadorean crude oil is not only
  for this emergency period but for the next five years, with
  possibility of an extension. Between 20,000 and 50,000 barrels
  per day (bpd) will be pumped along it,"" Perry said.
      Espinosa said Ecuador planned to pump 35 mln barrels
  through the link in the next five years, at a cost of 75 cents
  per barrel during the first year.
      The 43-km link, with a maximum capacity of 50,000 bpd, will
  run from Lago Agrio, the centre of of Ecuador's jungle
  oilfields, to an existing Colombian pipeline that runs to the
  Pacific port of Tumaco.
      Espinosa said the 32-km stretch of the link built on the
  Ecuadorean side cost 10.5 mln dlrs. Perry gave no figures for
  Colombia's 11 km segment but said it was ""insignificant compared
  with what we are going to earn.""
      OPEC member Ecuador was pumping around 250,000 bpd before
  the quake. Lost exports of 185,000 bpd are costing it 90 mln
  dlrs per month, Espinosa said.

  412 mln guilders from 402 mln in 1985, while turnover fell to
  17.7 billion guilders in 1986 from 24.1 billion in 1985.
      The company said 1986 dividend, which will be paid to the
  Dutch state in its capacity of the firm's sole shareholder,
  would be raised to 98 mln guilders from 70 mln guilders in
  1985.
      In an initial comment on its 1986 results, DSM said the
  drop in 1986 turnover had been caused mainly by losses in the
  company's fertilizer division.

test/15372,"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - TELECOM IS KEY JAPAN MINISTRY
  Japan's little-known Ministry of Posts and
  Telecommunications (MPT) has emerged as an international force
  to be reckoned with, political analysts said.
      MPT, thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the U.S.
  And Britain, is in a position of strength due to its control of
  a lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians,
  they said.
      ""The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control of
  a key industrial sector, telecommunications and information,""
  said one diplomatic source.
      ""They are a potent political force,"" the diplomatic source
  said.
      But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does not
  always help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analysts
  said.
      ""The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were not
  so internationalized,"" said Waseda University professor Mitsuru
  Uchida. ""Suddenly they're standing at the centre of the world
  community and in that sense, they're at a loss (as to) how to
  face the situation.""
      Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row with
  London over efforts by Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc to keep
  a major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in
  Japan's lucrative overseas telephone business.
      The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival
  groups, arguing the market cannot support more than one
  competitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which now
  monopolizes the business.
      It has also opposed a major management role in the planned
  merger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm on
  the grounds that no such international precedent exists.
      The ministry's stance has outraged both London, which has
  threatened to retaliate, and Washington, which says the merger
  plan is evidence of Japan's failure to honour pledges to open
  its telecommunications market.
      Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it
  says have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan's car
  telephone and satellite communications market.
      Much of MPT's new prominence stems from the growth of the
  sector it regulates.
      ""What has been happening is an important shift in the
  economy which makes the ministry a very important place,"" said
  James Abegglen, head of the consulting firm Asia Advisory
  Service Inc.
      A decision to open the telecommunications industry to
  competition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boosted
  rather than lessened MPT's authority, analysts said.
      ""With the legal framework eased, they became the de facto
  legal framework,"" said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst Darrell
  Whitten.
      Close links with the powerful political faction of the
  ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former Prime
  Minister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT's influence, the
  analysts said.
      ""Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s), but the Tanaka
  faction was forward looking and ... Recognized the importance
  of MPT,"" Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members of
  the influential political group, he added.
      The ministry also has power in the financial sector due to
  the more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in the
  Postal Savings System, analysts said.
      MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulate
  interest rates on small deposits, a key element in financial
  liberalisation, since the change would remove the Postal
  Savings System's ability to offer slightly higher rates than
  banks, they said.
      Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT's
  obstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterized
  the ministry as feudal.
      Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limiting
  competition and sheltering the former monopolies under its
  wing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest
  price takes a back seat to such considerations, they said.
      But many of the ministry's actions are not unlike those of
  its bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world
  including Britain, several analysts said.
      ""The United States is really the odd man out,"" Abegglen said.
  ""For a government to take the view that it wants to keep order
  in utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonable
  view,"" he said.

  Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said he
  was surprised by recent criticism of West German economic
  policies voiced by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker but
  added that the criticism was not purely one-sided.
      Stoltenberg told the West German Trade and Industry
  Association (DIHT) that before a meeting with Baker on Monday,
  ""There had been surprising notes of criticism (from the United
  States)."" He added. ""Criticism is not a one-way street.""
      He did not elaborate, but Bonn has often called on the U.S.
  To reduce its federal budget deficit.
      Over the weekend Baker had criticised West German economic
  policies, saying that rises in domestic interest rates here
  were not in the spirit of last February's Louvre pact to
  stabilise currencies.
      Stoltenberg told the DIHT that his meeting on Monday with
  Baker had resolved differences between the two countries.
      At a news conference earlier on Tuesday Stoltenberg had
  declined to comment specifically on Baker's criticisms, but he
  had said that after three hours of discussions on Monday, ""one
  remark or another has been clarified.""

  the company's annual meeting on June 22.
      The meeting had been postponed from its original date of
  May 14 in order to let management review recapitalization
  options, it said.
      In addition, Coopervision said operating income in its
  current fiscal quarter ending April 30 is expected to show an
  improvement over its prior fiscal quarter's 82.5 mln dlrs and
  its year ago quarter.
      Income from continuing operations was not immediately
  availalbe for the prior year's second quarter in which it
  reported a net loss of 14.9 mln dlrs.
      At a Drexel Burnham Lambert Investor Conference,
  Coopervision chairman Parker Montgomery said, as previously
  announced, he will listen to any bid that makes sense for
  shareholders.
      He also said Coopervision's stock fell in 1986 due to its
  second quarter loss, rumors of a liquidation at 30 dlrs and 35
  dlrs a share, and Ivan Boesky's subsequent sale of his
  position.
      ""The stock dropped six dlrs in three days after Boesky sold
  his position and has never recovered,"" Montgomery said. The
  company's stock is currently trading at 19-1/4.
      Montgomery further told the conference, ""Don't be an
  investor in the stock on the basis of any short term recovery
  in operating or net income in 1987 and 1988.""
      ""Our concentration is on maintaining or increasing market
  share in our core businesses this year and next, regardless of
  the impact to the bottom line,"" he said.

test/19191,"U.K. LENDERS OFFER MORE FIXED RATE MORTGAGES
  More U.K. Lenders are offering homebuyers
  fixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makes
  the same monthly payment no matter what happens to other
  interest rates.
      And with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels in
  years, the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyers
  trying to lock into cheap money.
      The decision to offer fixed rate loans, industry officials
  said, reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the home
  mortgage business.
      While fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the U.K., They
  were the mainstay of the business in the U.S. Up until only a
  few years ago.
      But in the early 1980s interest rates soared. U.S. Lenders,
  mostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as low
  as three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in their
  portfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct to
  induce them to retain their accounts.
      As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were
  forced to merge. The survivors decided to offer mortgages whose
  rates would move in line with the cost of funds.
      ""We very much have the example of the U.S. Thrifts in mind,""
  said a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society,
  explaining why his institution, for the time being, is only
  offering variable rate mortgages.
      The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped
  homebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders
  concede they are being forced to undercut each other still
  more.
      Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier
  this week by the nation's two largest building societies and by
  National Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition for
  new business, officials at all three institutions said.
      The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even
  below those on the variable rate loans.
      ""Of course they are less profitable than other (variable
  rate) mortgages,"" said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc, which
  earlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed rate
  new mortgage loans.
      But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable
  loans because, ""It was just another way to attract people to our
  mortgage product.""
      Trustee Savings Bank Plc (TSB) was offering five year fixed
  rate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year.
      The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans was
  exhausted within just a few days, according to a spokeswoman.
      ""Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage,"" she said, noting
  that within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pct
  of its 1986 volume.
      In short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they
  offer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest
  rates. If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the
  lender is earning an above average return on assets.
      But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won
  the benefit of cheap money.
      Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixed
  rate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumption
  that a Conservative Party victory would help money market rates
  fall further, according to Duncan Young, managing director.
      Young explained that the company had planned to protect
  itself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a
  complicated hedging instrument.
      But money market rates have risen contrary to expectations
  and the company has shelved its plans for the time being. He
  said money market rates were too high to arrange both the
  mortgages and hedge profitably.
      However, he said that when the Household Mortgage Co does
  make fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them. This
  means bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond
  and selling them to an investor.
      For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more
  efficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate
  mortgages. In the U.S., Where fixed rate mortgages are popular
  again, securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money
  over the past few years.

  Henry Kaufman, managing director of

  Greenspan to replace Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul
  Volcker is bearish in the near term for the fixed income and
  currency markets.
      ""The basic direction of interest rates is not changed. The
  fundamental direction of interest rates continues to be upward,
  interrupted by intermittent rallies,"" Kaufman said in a
  statement. He said the implication for equity markets in
  neutral to bullish.
      Kaufman said, ""Unlike Paul Volcker, who entered the office

      Greenspan is most knowledgeable on the behavior of the U.S.

  Union and New South Wales government

      But some unions, including those of building and mining
  workers, said they were dissatisfied with the deal and would
  continue their strikes for a few more days.
      State officials said the government had agreed to revise
  its proposals to cut compensation and would allow slightly

      Under the original proposal, which sparked strikes and

      He described the situation as ""extremely tense,"" but said
  Gulf military activity would not significantly affect prices

      Hernandez Grisanti said the supply/demand balance was
  precarious and prices were in danger of falling from their
  current average of about 18 dlrs per barrel if overproduction
  continued.
      Three or four members of the 13-nation Organisation of
  Petroleum Exporting Countries were ""overproducing in an

  Australian markets are booming as foreign

  currency of 0.71 U.S. Dlrs all illustrated the inflow.
      Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital
  are not available, but brokers said they received almost daily
  inquiries from Japan and the United States.
      ""These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about
  and they don't know what to do with it. Some of that is ending
  up here with the attraction of high interest rates and
  reasonable currency stability,"" National Australia Bank Ltd
  economist Brian Hamley said.
      ""There is a 'flight to quality',"" Hamley said. ""Australia may
  not be in the best (economic) position, but there aren't too
  many other countries where you'd want to put your money.""
      The stronger Australian dollar was also attracting
  investors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against
  the volatility of the U.S. Unit, analysts said.
      ""We're looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S.
  Where some people would be concerned about the value of the
  U.S. Dollar,"" Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose
  said. ""Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheap
  and the currency looks stable?""
      But turning that capital into more permanent productive
  investment depends on government economic policy, he said.
      ""It will only disappear if people lose confidence in the
  direction in the economy,"" Buttrose said, adding that offshore
  investors would carefully watch the government's promised tough
  economic statement on May 14.
      While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding
  interest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just as
  easily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese, who were
  badly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollar
  and hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said.
      ""It will remain very edgy money. If something was not to be
  delivered, if the statement wasn't considered tough enough, one
  might see a substantial outflow,"" Buttrose said.
      Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tough
  economic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and
  stubborn current account deficit, analysts said.
      ""They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I think
  they would like to leave the money here,"" Buttrose said.
      Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increased
  interest in investment in Australia and the need to shield
  Japanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations.
      Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged an
  element of targeting the rate against the yen in currency
  policy when he said authorities could not take their ""eyes off
  the yen"" because of the crucial role of Japanese investors.
      Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had worked
  successfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollar
  within the range of 100 to 103 yen.
      Apart from its recovery against a weak U.S. Dollar, the
  Australian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a
  trade-weighted basis in the last three weeks.
      Offshore buying has also played a role in the booming
  Australian share market. It has followed Wall Street and other
  markets, but is also setting its own trend in response to the
  weight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into
  equities, particularly in the gold sector.
      The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3
  today, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, while
  the gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in the
  same period.
      The property sector is also sought after, with Japanese
  companies that have invested heavily in the United States in
  recent years turning their attention to undervalued real
  estate, particularly in the tourism field.
      Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydney's five-star
  Regent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs
  as indicative of the type of property being sought.
      ""They think they find good value real estate here which,
  with long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind of
  investment Australia needs,"" Buttrose added.

  Kuwait, a target of Iranian anger over the
  emirate's backing for Iraq in the Gulf war, today rejected
  charges that fishing vessels seized recently by Iran were spy
  boats.
      ""There are no bases of truth to the contents of the Iranian
  accusation on the nature of the operations of the vessels
  recently taken into custody by Iran. These vessels were out
  fishing,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
      It said Iranian Charge d'Affaires Mohammad Baqeri was
  summoned by the Ministry yesterday to confer with Foreign
  Undersecretary Suleiman Majed al-Shaheen.
      The Iranian News Agency IRNA said on Sunday Iran had seized
  seven Kuwaiti speed boats and detained their crew, who
  confessed to spying for Iraq under the cover of fishing.
      It said the boats were intercepted in the Khur Abdullah
  waterway which separates Kuwait and Iraq's Faw peninsula at the
  head of the Gulf, captured by Iran last year.
      The Kuwaiti response came as Iranian envoys toured Gulf
  Arab states saying responsibility for security and stability in
  the waterway was a regional matter. A U.S. Senate team was
  scheduled today to meet Kuwait's Crown Prince and Prime
  Minister Sheikh Saad al-Abdulla al-Sabah and the defence and
  oil ministers.
      Today's Foreign Ministry statement, carried by the Kuwait
  News Agency KUNA, said the recent detention of Kuwaiti fishing
  vessels by Iran was not the first.
      Tehran in the past had held back a number of vessels Kuwait
  had sought to release through diplomatic contacts, it said.
      ""However, Kuwait is perplexed that this time the Iranian
  charges are accompanied by accusations that the vessels were
  undertaking espionage activities,"" it said.
      Shaheen condemned the detentions and accusations, and asked
  Tehran to free all fishing boats and sailors held by Iran, the
  statement said.

test/18075,"ALLEGIS &lt;AEG> TO SELL CANADIAN HOTELS
  Allegis Corp said it has created a
  limited partnership to sell selected hotels in Canada to the
  public.
      It said the offering is expected to raise in excess of 350
  mln Canadian dlrs and will be completed by the end of
  September.
      The limited partnership will be similar to the Westin
  Hotels limited partnership completed last year when Allegis
  sold Westin hotels in San Francisco and Chicago. Allegis
  reported a pretax gain of 80.6 mln dlrs as a result of that
  partnership.
     
      An Allegis spokesman said the offerings have been in
  planning stages for a long time and are unrelated to recent
  corporate developments such as the firm's recapitalization plan
  and a threatened takeover by an investor group lead by Coniston
  Partners and the pilots of its United Airlines unit.
      The spokesman said the company has not yet identified which
  of its Canadian hotels will be offered for sale.
      Allegis has 100 pct ownership in Westin hotels in
  Vancouver, Calgary, Ottawa and Toronto, and 100 pct interest in
  Hilton International hotels in Toronto and Montreal. It owns 60
  pct of the Westin in Edmonton.
      Richard Ferris, chairman of Allegis, said in a statement
  the hotel limited partnerships allow the company to convert
  unrecognized asset appreciation into cash.
      As with the proceeds from the earlier limited partnership,
  the money will be used for general corporate needs, the
  spokesman said.
      Merrill Lynch Capital Markets and Wood Gundy will be lead
  underwriters for to the public offering. The limited
  partnership will be offered outside the U.S, Allegis said.
