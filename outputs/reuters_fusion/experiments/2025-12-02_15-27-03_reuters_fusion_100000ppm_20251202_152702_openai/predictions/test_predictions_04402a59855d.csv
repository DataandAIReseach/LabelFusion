  &lt;Virginia Federal Savings and Loan
  Association> said it has signed a definitive agreement to be
  acquired by &lt;Montrose Holding Co>, an affiliate of &lt;Montrose
  Capital Corp> for 20 mln dlrs.
      Virginia Federal and Montrose Capital said the agreement
  provides for the conversion of Virginia Federal from a mutual
  to a stock association and the purchase of 100 pct of its stock
  for 20 mln dlrs by Montrose.
      According to the companies, Virginia Federal has over 700
  mln dlrs in assets and operates 16 branches in Virginia.
      Virginia Federal said the proceeds would enable it to
  provide increased mortgage and lending services and enable the
  company to compete more effectively in the Virginia market.
      The companies said the agreement is subject to Federal Home
  Loan Bank Board approval, expected later this year.
      Additionally, the companies said the converted association
  would be managed by a board of directors consisting of the six
  current Virginia Federal directors and two representatives of
  Montrose Holding.
      The senior management of Virginia Federal was expected to
  continue in office after the conversion, the companies said.

      Completion of the proposed transaction, subject to

      Separately, Deluxe said its Data Card investment no longer

  Card since 1975 when it provided funds for Data Card to buy

  DataCard Corp said it adopted a
  dividend rights plan in response to Deluxe Check Printers Inc
  &lt;DLX> having agreed to sell its 38 pct interest in DataCard to
  National Computer Systems Inc &lt;NLCS.O>.
      DataCard declared a dividend distribution of one preferred
  stock purchase right on each outstanding share its common
  stock. The dividend is designed to deter National Computer or
  other potential suitors from preventing DataCard from
  evaluating all alternatives to maximize shareholder value,
  DataCard said.
     
      National Computer told Reuters June 22 it could make a bid
  for DataCard. On June 25 DataCard filed suit in Hennepin County
  District Court in Minnesota to block the sale of the 38 pct
  stake of its stock to National Computer.
      In announcing the rights plan, DataCard said it ""is not
  designed to deter takeovers that would be consistent with the
  objective of maximizing stockholders value to all of DataCard's
  stockholders.""
      The rights will not become exercisable until 10 days after
  an announcement that a person or group has acquired beneficial
  ownership of 44 pct or more of DataCard's common stock.
     
      Once exercisable, each right would entitle a holder to buy
  1/500th of a share of DataCard Series A junior participation
  preferred Stock for 35 dlrs. Holders other than an acquirer
  would be entitled to purchase, for six-months after the right
  becomes exercisable, a number of shares of the new preferred
  stock with a market value equal to twice the exercise price of
  the rights.
      The rights dividend distribution is payable July 9 to
  shareholders of record July 9.

  Artillery shells from an exchange of fire

      There were rumors in world oil markets on Tuesday that Iran
  had fired shells at an oil camp in northern Kuwait in
  retaliation for U.S. Attacks on Iranian oil platforms in the
  Gulf on Monday. ""Several shells fell in a random manner on the

  seems these shells arose from an exchange of fire between Iran

  Allegis Corp said it has created a
  limited partnership to sell selected hotels in Canada to the
  public.
      It said the offering is expected to raise in excess of 350
  mln Canadian dlrs and will be completed by the end of
  September.
      The limited partnership will be similar to the Westin
  Hotels limited partnership completed last year when Allegis
  sold Westin hotels in San Francisco and Chicago. Allegis
  reported a pretax gain of 80.6 mln dlrs as a result of that
  partnership.
     
      An Allegis spokesman said the offerings have been in
  planning stages for a long time and are unrelated to recent
  corporate developments such as the firm's recapitalization plan
  and a threatened takeover by an investor group lead by Coniston
  Partners and the pilots of its United Airlines unit.
      The spokesman said the company has not yet identified which
  of its Canadian hotels will be offered for sale.
      Allegis has 100 pct ownership in Westin hotels in
  Vancouver, Calgary, Ottawa and Toronto, and 100 pct interest in
  Hilton International hotels in Toronto and Montreal. It owns 60
  pct of the Westin in Edmonton.
      Richard Ferris, chairman of Allegis, said in a statement
  the hotel limited partnerships allow the company to convert
  unrecognized asset appreciation into cash.
      As with the proceeds from the earlier limited partnership,
  the money will be used for general corporate needs, the
  spokesman said.
      Merrill Lynch Capital Markets and Wood Gundy will be lead
  underwriters for to the public offering. The limited
  partnership will be offered outside the U.S, Allegis said.
