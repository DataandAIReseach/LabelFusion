  Confronted by new hostilities
  involving U.S. forces in the Gulf, the U.S. Senate voted to end
  Republican stalling tactics and limit debate on a measure that
  could give Congress a larger role in Gulf policy.
      The measure, however, does not require President Reagan to
  comply with the 1973 War Powers Act as does a related Senate
  bill. The controversial War Powers Act could require a pullout
  of U.S. forces from the Gulf.
      The Senate voted 67-28 to stop a filibuster and limit
  debate to 30 hours on a bipartisan measure that requires Reagan
  to report to Congress on Gulf policy within 60 days and calls
  for a resolution to be passed in the House and Senate on the
  situation in the volatile waterway 30 days later.
      The resolution could be about any Gulf-related issue,
  including an expression of support or of disapproval for
  Reagan's policy of protecting 11 Kuwaiti tankers from Iran in
  the waterway. The Pentagon said the 12th U.S.-protected convoy
  began moving through the Gulf early Tuesday.
