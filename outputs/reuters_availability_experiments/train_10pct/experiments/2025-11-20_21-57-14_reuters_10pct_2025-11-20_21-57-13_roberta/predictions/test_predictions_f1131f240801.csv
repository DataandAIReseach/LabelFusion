test/18642,"INDONESIA REJECTS WORLD BANK FARM REFORM IDEAS
  Indonesia rejected World Bank
  recommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, as
  the country's foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5
  billion dlrs in grants and soft loans.
      Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarks
  distributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations met
  at The Hague, said, ""The general argument presented by the Bank
  for this free trade, open economy view is weak.""
      The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages the
  largest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agricultural
  growth was stagnating under subsidies for rice farming.
      The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peaked
  and the subsidies are a waste of money.
      Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and provides
  an income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies were
  needed to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,
  exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well as
  assisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.
      Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmers
  should be free to choose their own crops, but he said the
  government would continue to maintain production targets for
  ""strategic commodities"" such as rice and sugar.
      The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia's
  drive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are double
  the world average because of inefficiencies, and the country
  would save money by importing the commodity.
      However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the need
  to save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugar
  industry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.
      He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in the
  agricultural sector were needed to help domestic industry
  develop and because of ""over-production and price intervention
  in the developed nations.""

  Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister Hisham Nazer
  said Riyadh would not agree to a cut in oil prices and would
  not accept a ""mad"" increase that would drive consumers away.
      He told al-Riyadh newspaper, ""Saudi Arabia follows a
  balanced petroleum policy. It does not approve of a decrease in
  prices from current levels and it also does not accept a mad
  increase that would drive consumers away and make them try and
  find alternative sources (for energy).""
      OPEC agreed last December to cut production after world
  prices hit new lows in 1986. They agreed on a pricing system
  aimed to stabilise the market around 18 dlrs a barrel.
      OPEC is scheduled to meet in Vienna on June 25, where it
  will review its current oil price and production policy.
      Saudi Arabia's King Fahd said last month that he wanted oil
  prices to remain stable for the next two years.
      Saudi Arabia is the architect of the current pricing and
  production pact, which is backed by Kuwait and the UAE. The
  current pact set a production ceiling for first half 1987 of
  15.8 mln bpd, and implemented fixed prices based on an 18 dlrs
  a barrel average.

test/16130,"OFFER FOR DOME MAY SHORT-CIRCUIT ITS DEBT TALKS
  A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome
  Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO>
  may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the door
  for more takeover bids, oil analysts said.
      Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt
  of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim
  debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer
  substantial payments to creditors will expire.
      Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders
  that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan.
      Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as
  public noteholders in March after several months of delicate
  negotiations.
      TransCanada's proposal ""amounts to a quasi debt
  restructuring,"" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker
  Ltd said from Toronto.
      Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow
  creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet
  to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to
  cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.
      ""The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that
  even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that
  Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,""
  said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in
  Calgary.
      TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome
  was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed
  refinancing packages, Gobert said.
      The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome
  since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders
  to agree to a restructuring, he added.
      ""I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain
  any and all offers (for Dome),"" Gobert said.
      Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that
  TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix
  the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other
  possible buyers from making an offer. ""By drawing attention to
  us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little
  reluctant to come forward,"" he said.
      Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal
  offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a
  confidential agreement between the two companies, he said.
      Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions
  with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other
  unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and
  financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including
  TransCanada's.
      Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price
  for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.
      However, he said not enough financial details are known
  about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of
  TransCanada's proposed offer.
