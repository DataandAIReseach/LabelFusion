training/9770,"U.K. VISIBLE TRADE DEFICIT NARROWS IN FEBRUARY
  Britain's visible trade deficit narrowed
  to a seasonally adjusted provisional 224 mln stg in February
  from 527 mln in January, The Trade and Industry Department
  said.
      The current account balance of payments in February showed
  a seasonally adjusted provisional surplus of 376 mln stg
  compared with a surplus of 73 mln in January.
      Invisibles in February were put provisionally at a 600 mln
  surplus, the same as in January.
      Seasonally adjusted, imports rose in February to 7.16
  billion stg from 6.73 billion in January. Exports rose to a
  record 6.93 billion last month from 6.20 billion in January.
      Trade Department officials said the improvement in
  Britain's current account contrasted with most private
  forecasts and they attributed much of the strength to imports
  rising less quickly in February than might otherwise have been
  expected.
      The Department said exceptionally cold weather in January
  reduced exports that month and that there had been an element
  of catching up in the February figures.
      The seasonally adjusted volume index, base 1980, a guide to
  underlying non-oil trade, showed exports rising to 131.0 from
  114.6 in January and imports rising to 142.2 from 136.5.
      The value of British oil exports in February rose to 751
  mln stg from 723 mln in Jnauary while oil imports rose to 425
  mln from 352 mln.
      The Department said the upward trend in non-oil export
  volume continues and the underlying level of non-oil import
  volume seems to have stablised.
      The Departnment said exports to the U.S. May be benefiting
  from fluctuations in the mark and yen exchange rates.

  Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp will

      ""We expect to file papers late tonight"" asking the ICC to

      The ICC had rejected in July, on grounds it would reduce

  Railroads.
      The deadline for seeking ICC reconsideration of the merger
  plan is midnight tonight.
      Santa Fe Southern Pacific owns the Santa Fe railroad and
  holds the Southern Pacific railroad assets in trust while
  awaiting federal approval of the merger plan.
      The ICC had ordered the holding company to divest one or
  the other railroad but stayed its ruling pending a decision on
  the request for reconsideration.
      If the ICC ultimately decides not to reopen the case, it is
  expected to reinstate the divestiture order.

  Galactic Resources
  Ltd, earlier reporting a 1986 loss of 25.6 mln U.S. dlrs, said
  it adopted a more conservative accounting policy, similar to
  other gold producers' accounting for exploration costs.
      As a result, the company retroactively charged all past
  exploration and related administration costs incurred on its
  properties against expenses in 1986, 1985 and 1984.
      Under the new policy, all future exploration and related
  administration costs will be written off to expenses rather
  than capitalized as an intangible asset, it said.
      Galactic said the accounting change resulted in a 22.8 mln
  U.S. dlr charge against 1986 earnings. It did not immediately
  disclose the affect of the change on prior years' results.
      The new accounting policy is not expected to adversely
  affect working capital position, future cash flows or the
  company's ability to conduct ongoing business operations, it
  said.
      Galactic said the charge includes 9.9 mln U.S. dlrs of
  costs concerning its Summitville Mine leach pad and 8.9 mln
  U.S. dlrs in waste removal costs, dyke construction and other
  mine developments.
      Galactic said under the prior accounting policy, the
  Summitville mine expenses would have been amortized over the
  life of the mine and charged against future earnings.
      The change will also result in lower depreciation and
  amortization charges against income of about 52 U.S. dlrs an
  ounce of gold produced in future periods, based on total
  estimated reserves of 617,000 ounces.
      Galactic said March leaching production at Summitville is
  expected to exceed 2,500 ounces, raising gold equivalent
  production since the June 5, 1986 start of leaching to 65,000
  ounces.

      Todd said the 75 ct preferred dividend will be paid May one
  to shareholders of record April 15.
      The company said it omitted the common dividend to cover
  both losses from a commercial ship conversion contract and
  increased reserves for previously announced discontinued
  shipyard operations.
      In addition, the company said its lenders agreed to
  temporarily reduce the net worth requirement of its revolving
  credit and term-loan pact to 140 mln dlrs from 130 mln.
      The reduction will hold through May 15, it said.
      Todd said the reduction in the net worth requirement
  allowed for the payment of the preferred dividend and prevented
  it from violating covenants of its credit agreement.
      The company said it is also negotiating with its lenders to
  extend the reduced net worth terms beyond May 15.
      Todd added that it has suffered financially because of the
  U.S. Navy's unwillingness to release certain retentions under

training/1940,"TAIWAN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES HIT NEW HIGH
  Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves hit a
  new high of more than 51 billion U.S. Dlrs on March 4, compared
  with 50 billion in mid-February and 25.1 billion a year
  earlier, the central bank said.
      Bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters the increase
  came mainly from the bank's purchases of more than one billion
  U.S. Dlrs on the local interbank market between February 18 and
  March 4.
      He said the rise showed signs of slowing, however, because
  Taiwan has liberalised import policy and expects its trade
  surplus to decline over the next few months as a result.
      Chang declined to predict how high the reserves might rise,
  but local economists have forecast they will hit 60 billion
  U.S. Dlrs by the end of 1987.
      In January, Taiwan reduced import tariffs of up to 50 pct
  on some 1,700 foreign products. It had been under growing U.S.
  Pressure to cut its 1986 record 13.6 billion dlr trade surplus
  with the U.S. Taiwan's 1985 surplus with the U.S. Was 10.2
  billion, according to official statistics.
      Wang Chang-Ming, Vice Chairman of the Council for Economic
  Planning and Development, told Reuters the government is
  planning another round of deep tariff cuts in the second half
  of this year.
      The reserves could support imports of more than two years
  for Taiwan, compared with about three months for Japan and the
  U.S.

  49 pct of Canadian Tire common shares.

training/1967,"FRENCH INTERVENTION RATE CUT LIKELY, DEALERS SAY
  The Bank of France is likely to cut its
  money market intervention rate by up to a quarter point at the
  start of next week.  This follows a steady decline in the call
  money rate over the past 10 days and signals from the Finance
  Ministry that the time is ripe for a fall, dealers said.
      The call money rate peaked at just above nine pct ahead of
  the meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Five
  industrial countries and Canada on February 22, which restored
  considerable stability to foreign exchanges after several weeks
  of turbulence.
      The call money rate dropped to around 8-3/8 pct on February
  23, the day after the Paris accord, and then edged steadily
  down to eight pct on February 27 and 7-3/4 pct on March 3,
  where it has now stabilised.
      Dealers said the Bank of France intervened to absorb
  liquidity to hold the rate at 7-3/4 pct.
      While call money has dropped by well over a percentage
  point, the Bank of France's money market intervention rate has
  remained unchanged since January 2, when it was raised to eight
  pct from 7-1/4 pct in a bid to stop a franc slide.
      The seven-day repurchase rate has also been unchanged at
  8-3/4 since it was raised by a half-point on January 5.
      The Bank of France has begun using the seven-day repurchase
  rate to set an upper indicator for money market rates, while
  using the intervention rate to set the floor.
      Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said
  that he would be happy to see an interest rate cut, and dealers
  said any fall in the intervention rate was most likely to come
  when the Bank of France buys first category paper next Monday,
  although an earlier cut could not be excluded.
     A cut in the seven-day repurchase rate could come as early
  as tomorrow morning, banking sources said.
      They said recent high interest rates have encouraged an
  acceleration in foreign funds returning to France, discouraging
  the authorities from making a hasty rate cut. But they also
  pointed out that money supply is broadly back on target, giving
  scope for a small fall in rates.
      M-3 money supply, the government's key aggregate, finished
  1986 within the government's three to five pct growth target,
  rising 4.6 pct compared with seven pct in 1985.

training/13531,"NO INTERVENTION, DOLLAR FIXED AT 1.8218 MARKS
  The Bundesbank did not intervene as
  the dollar was fixed lower at 1.8218 marks after 1.8243
  yesterday, dealers said.
      Dealers said dollar trading was very quiet over the
  European morning, with operators made wary by today's meeting
  of the Group of Five finance ministers and central bank chiefs
  ahead of the full IMF/World Bank session in Washington.
      It was undermined by remarks from U.S. Council of Economic
  Advisers Chairman Beryl Sprinkel who told Iowa bankers the U.S.
  Had no objective regarding the value of the dollar.
      Sprinkel also called the reference to stabilizing exchange
  rates at about current levels, made at the Paris meeting on
  February 22, a ""vague statement,"" casting doubt on operators'
  assumptions that a secret target level had been set.
      Sprinkel added that if West Germany and Japan made progress
  to stimulate their economies as the Paris agreement envisaged,
  ""there would not be the necessity of significant declines in the
  dollar.""
      One dealer for a U.S.-based bank noted the dollar tended
  easier after the remarks. ""They were obviously regarded as being
  negative. And if the market starts regarding anything that
  comes out negatively then it means that the underlying
  sentiment is negative,"" he said.
      Some early selling pressure softened the dollar's
  undertone.
      Most operators overlooked intervention by the Bank of Japan
  to support the dollar against selling in favour of the yen by
  institutional investors and overseas operators, dealers said.
      After the strong focus on the dollar/yen rate in recent
  weeks up to the end of the Japanese financial year on March 31,
  interest and activity was likely to switch, dealers said.
      ""We can start to look at a point in time where the interest
  shifts away from dollar/yen and more into dollar/mark and the
  other European currencies,"" the U.S. Bank dealer said.
      Despite the softer undertone, traders would remain wary of
  taking significant new positions during the Washington
  meetings, dealers said. Aside from the G-5 session today,
  Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl is due to meet the German
  Affairs group on international monetary issues later.
      The mark gained some strength from news the Bundesbank set
  a new securities repurchase tender to add money market
  liquidity at a fixed 3.80 pct, unchanged from those over the
  last several weeks. Some expectation had been growing that it
  might cut the rate or move to a minimum interest rate tender,
  signalling a desire for a slight easing in credit policy.
      Bundesbank central bank council member Lothar Mueller said
  the Bundesbank had not given up its focus on money supply. A
  monetary policy which took into account exchange rates and
  capital flows could not be confused with an exchange-rate
  oriented policy, he said, contradicting some growing sentiment.
      Sterling eased a touch to 2.950 marks at the fixing from
  2.957. The yen's unabated strength, despite the intervention,
  brought it up to 1.2555 marks per 100 from yesterday's 1.2480.
      The Swiss franc rose to a fix of 120.515 marks per 100 from
  120.180. The French franc eased to 30.055 marks per 100 after
  30.060, Belgian franc was little changed at 4.829 marks per
  100.

training/1377,"AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO PAY SUBSIDIES--USDA
  The Australian Government will likely
  reimburse the Australian Wheat Board, AWB, about 132 mln (U.S.)
  dlrs to pay wheat farmers for their 1986/87 crop, the U.S.
  Agriculture Department said.
      In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the
  department said the sharp fall in world wheat prices has
  reduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levels
  insufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated at
  around 98 dlrs per tonne.
       For example the recent large sales of wheat to China (1.5
  mln tonnes) and Egypt (2.0 mln tonnes) were well below the
  breakeven export price, it said.
      Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advance
  payment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price, GMP, calculated
  at 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the current
  year and the two lowest of the previous three years, the
  department said.
      In addition, deductions for taxes, freight, handling and
  storage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives.
      But the department said the Australian Bureau of
  Agricultural Economics, BAE, predicts wheat production will
  drop sharply from 17.8 mln tonnes in 1986/87 to 13.5 mln in
  1989/90.
      The decline will result from low world grain prices leading
  to shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit U.S.
  wheat exports, the department said.

  Companies will henceforth be able to own
  stakes in banks, but these should not constitute a ""dominant""
  holding, an Italian government committee ruled.
      The Interministerial Committee on Credit and Savings,
  headed by Treasury Minister Giovanni Goria, said its decision
  reflected the ""need to safeguard the principle of separation
  between banks and non-financial concerns.""
      It did not quantify what might constitute a ""dominant""
  holding.
      The committee also set conditions for the allocation of
  credits by banks to companies or individuals holding stakes in
  them, and stipulates conditions under which the Bank of Italy
  could exercise its powers of control in the case of stakes held
  by banks in companies or other banks.
      Under the ruling, credits given by banks or their
  subsidiaries to groups or individuals holding five pct or more
  of the bank's capital must not exceed defined limits.
      The value of credits given cannot exceed either one-fifth
  of the combined capital and reserves of the bank itself or
  two-fifths of the value of the stake owned in the bank by the
  group or individual concerned.
      Exceptions to these conditions include credits to concerns
  in which the bank itself has a stake and to branches of foreign
  banks. Credits made by foreign companies or banks to
  subsidiaries which have their legal base in Italy will also be
  excluded from the conditions.
      The Bank of Italy will request banks to insert rules in
  their statutes to ensure that companies or individuals holding
  five pct or more of the bank's capital are not given privileged
  treatment with regard to credit allocation and terms.
      With regard to bank holdings in companies, the Bank of
  Italy can exercise supervisory controls when information on a
  bank's consolidated activities show single shareholdings in a
  company or another bank of 25 pct or more, owned directly or
  indirectly.
      Such controls can also be exercised even if the stake held
  is below 25 pct if it can be considered a controlling interest.
      The controls will not be exercised in cases where the value
  of the bank's stake in a concern is below the lesser of two
  predefined limits.
      These limits are set at 15 billion lire or two pct of the
  total assets of the parent company of the shareholding bank.

      Fiscal 1985 ended September 30, while fiscal 1986 ended
  November 30.
      Takefman said the company is actively looking for
  acquisitions in the consumer products industry, likely in
  Canada.
      The company said it expects to resolve delivery problems
  this year which last year hindered the growth of its toy
  distribution business, which accounts for about one-third of
  revenues.
      Charan is the exclusive distributor in Canada for &lt;Worlds
  of Wonder> toys, which include the Teddy Ruxpin voice-activated
  talking plush bear.
      Takefman said new products this year, which will be on the
  shelves for Christmas, include a smaller version of Teddy
  Ruxpin, a talking Mickey Mouse toy, dancing plush toys, a doll
  with a voice activated by sound, touch, light and heat, and
  talking books.
      The company is also marketing an extended line of ""laser
  tag"" kits, which shoot rays of light and tell you when you've
  hit someone.
      Other products include a recorder device which allows
  students to leave taped messages in each others' school
  lockers, retailing for about 60 dlrs.

training/3065,"OECD TRADE, GROWTH SEEN SLOWING IN 1987
  The 24 nations of the Organisation for
  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), hampered by
  sluggish industrial output and trade, face slower economic
  growth, and their joint balance of payments will swing into
  deficit in 1987, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said.
      The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD
  economic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a
  2.8 pct growth forecast in December.
      It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the
  smaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardest
  hit by currency appreciation this year.
      The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth
  rate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct in
  December and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan.
      It said it expected the OECD to post a current account
  deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due in
  large part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices.
      It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely to
  fall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in
  1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986.
      It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr
  payments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year.
      The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50
  dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18
  dlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes
  increasingly ragged.
      It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in
  foreign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on its
  trade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last
  year's 18.4 pct drop.
      The average mark/dollar rate is put at 1.80 marks this year
  and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate is expected to break
  through the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in
  1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said.
      ""This is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeper angle
  of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball rather
  than a three-point landing,"" the EIU said.
      ""Talking will not stop the dollar's slide for long and the
  February meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five and
  Canada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to
  more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighter
  U.S. Fiscal policy,"" it said.
      It said the key to the dollar's fortunes was the
  willingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Government
  assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss.
      ""Thus far they have been willing,"" the EIC said, adding that
  if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. Bonds the dollar would
  collapse.
      To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rates
  would have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debt
  crisis, it said.
      On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look ""increasingly
  sick.""
      Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seen
  slowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to
  4.2 pct in 1988, it said.
      The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest
  single factor, with import growth there expected to feature a
  sluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in
  December, the EIU said.
      On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in West
  Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, while
  Japan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S.
  Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower, more
  competitively-priced dollar.
      It said in most of Europe and in Japan, raw materials and
  oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986.
      However, rates of inflation will edge up in 1988 to over
  the current OECD average of three pct. Non-oil commodity prices
  will show a modest dollar price increase in 1988 for the first
  time since 1984, the EIU said.
      After a rise of 18 pct in 1986, the dollar price of
  internationally traded manufactures will go up by 8.5 pct in
  1987 and by five pct in 1988, it said.
      It said OECD industrial production would rise by only 1.6
  pct in 1987 after a weak 1.5 pct increase in 1986.

  The admission of China to GATT, which is the multinational

  would offer both potential export markets and potential

  Philippine Secretary of
  Trade and Industry Jose Concepcion, who two days ago expressed
  doubts about agreements produced at international conferences,
  said he was pleased with the latest gathering here.
      Concepcion told Reuters in an interview that the informal
  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting gave
  ministers from more than 20 nations the chance to examine
  issues with which GATT did not have the political will to deal.
      ""Also, the role of the developing countries has been
  emphasised in this particular meeting. Somehow it has been the
  perception of developing countries that GATT is a club of rich
  countries,"" he added in an interview with Reuters.
      ""In fact many of the issues that have been tabled for
  discussion (in the Uruguay round of trade negotiations) will be
  of more benefit to the developed countries,"" he said.
      Concepcion said at the start of the Taupo meeting that the
  Uruguay round was meant to be a ""shining act of faith"" in the
  world trade system.
      Concepcion said the Philippines would address the issues of
  trade in tropical fruit and the improvement of GATT machinery
  to make it more responsive.
      He said tropical fruit came from developing countries but
  faced non-tariff barriers, quantitative restrictions or very
  high duties in other nations. Concepcion named Japan and South
  Korea as examples.
      He said he would go to Wellington for talks with New
  Zealand, which had a surplus in trade with the Philippines, to
  encourage it to switch imports from other countries. He noted
  that New Zealand bought its bananas from Ecuador.

training/3798,"ENERGY/FOREIGN INVESTORS
  Lured by the weakening dollar and the
  conviction that oil prices are poised for a rebound, European
  energy companies are buying up cheap U.S. oil and gas reserves
  to replenish their supplies, oil industry analysts said.
      They said owning oil reserves in a politically stable
  United States is good insurance against future shortages.
  However, the quick pace of foreign investment has heated up
  competition among European firms, well-heeled U.S.
  institutional investors and major oil companies to snare choice
  domestic oil properties.
      Strevig and Associates, a Houston firm that tracks oil and
  gas reserve sales, said growing interest among foreign buyers
  had helped push reserve prices in recent months higher. All
  buyers of U.S. reserves paid a median price of 6.45 dlrs a
  barrel of oil during the fourth quarter of 1986 for
  acquisitions, up from 5.33 dlrs in the third quarter and five
  dlrs in the second quarter, according to the firm's research.
      ""Foreign investors have been here nibbling a long time, but
  we're seeing new names and smaller companies coming in,"" said
  Arthur Smith, an oil property appraisal specialist and
  president of John S. Herold Inc in Greenwich, Conn.
      ""Europeans, especially, do not have much indigenous oil and
  gas and realize the tide will eventually turn in favor of the
  Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,"" he added.
      Smith and other oil industry analyst and economists believe
  the trend in foreign investments will continue in 1987 because
  of the fall in value of the U.S. dollar, the perception that
  oil prices have hit bottom and the fact that it is cheaper to
  buy new reserves than to explore for them.
      Plenty of properties are available on the market, thanks to
  the need of many companies to raise cash for debt payments and
  general restructuring throughout the oilpatch.
      In two of the biggest transactions of recent months,
  French-owned Minatome Corp., a unit of &lt;Total Compagnie
  Francaise des Petroles>, spent more than 230 mln dlrs to
  separately acquire oil assets of Texas International &lt;TEICC>
  and Lear Petroleum Partners &lt;LPP>. A spokesman for Minatome
  said the company is searching for additional acquisitions.
      A partnership of two Belgian-owned firms, &lt;Petrofina S.A.>
  and &lt;Cometra Oil S.A.> paid 150 mln dlrs late last year to buy
  virtually all the exploration assets of the Williams Cos &lt;WMB>,
  the Oklahoma pipeline firm.
      But Japanese investors prefer entering into joint ventures
  with experienced U.S. companies to explore for new oil. Japan's
  &lt;Nippon Oil> is a partner of Texaco Inc's &lt;TX> Texaco USA in a
  100 mln dlrs U.S. drilling program, and has joined with
  Dupont's &lt;DD> Conoco Inc in a similar 135 dlrs mln deal.
      Most buyers said the pay-back period of a property, its
  geographic location and the lifting cost of the crude oil are
  more important factors in evaluating potential acquisitions
  than relying on a simple price-per-barrel formula.
      Rich Hodges, a Houston-based land manager representing
  International Oil and Gas Corp, a partnership of &lt;Preussag
  Corp> and &lt;C. Deilmann Inc> of West Germany, said the firm had
  earmarked at least 50 mln dlrs to spend on oil reserves in
  Texas, Oklahoma or Louisiana in the coming months.
      But he called that a small amount compared to the amount
  other investors have for acquisitions. PaineWebber's Geodyne
  Energy Income Fund, for example, has said it plans to spend up
  to 300 mln dlrs on oil and gas properties.
      ""The competition is stiff, not only from other foreign
  investors but from the brokerage houses and U.S. oil
  companies,"" he said. ""Our company is shopping around because we
  feel it's substantially less risky than pure exploration. If
  you're going to take the risk inherent in exploration, you need
  prices higher than the current market,"" he added.
      In addition to the foreign investors and U.S. brokerage
  houses, analysts said many of the major oil companies were also
  competing for prime properties.
      Houston-based Shell Oil Co, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group
  &lt;RD>, has been one of the most active companies in buying and
  selling reserves, Smith said. Since 1982, Shell has acquired
  two billion dlrs in new reserves, including 470 mln barrels of
  oil equivalent at a net cost of 2.80 dlrs a barrel, he said.
      ""Buying reserves is a good strategy for most of these
  companies,"" Smith said. ""Domestic production has dropped by one
  mln barrels a day because of cutbacks in drilling and it may
  drop by another one mln barrels a day in 1988.""

  Japanese customers have bought nearly six
  mln barrels of crude oil from the National Iranian Oil Company
  (NIOC) at a substantial discount to the official price, and
  Western traders have received even larger discounts, Japanese
  traders involved in the transactions told Reuters.
      NIOC has sold its crude for March shipment to Japanese
  customers with different formulas. One company has bought
  800,000 barrels of Iranian Heavy at a straight discount of
  30-35 cents below the official price, the sources said.
      Other deals have been fixed with prices linked to Oman and
  Dubai spot prices less a discount, they said.
  
      Iran's discounted sales have not, however, managed to
  reverse the bullish tone in the crude oil and products spot
  markets, oil traders said.
      Market sentiment is being influenced more by the colder
  weather in Europe, and reports that OPEC's February output was
  below its self-imposed quota of 15.8 mln barrels per day.
      Firmer gas oil on the London futures, and more bullish
  sentiment on the New York Mercantile Exchange futures market
  are supporting spot price levels, they said.
  
      Another Japanese trading house has paid the official price
  but through a processing arrangement will effectively receive a
  discount, the sources said. ""It's just disguised cheating,"" one
  Japanese trader said.
      The sources said only one Japanese company had paid the
  official price for Iranian oil. It has purchased 1.5 mln
  barrels of Iranian Heavy for April shipment for refining in
  Singapore. They said about nine VLCCs of Iranian crude have
  been sold to Western traders with pricing based 60 pct on the
  official price and 40 pct on spot prices, or with part of the
  price related to processing arrangements.

training/12136,"CURRENCY INTERVENTION TIMING CRUCIAL - ANALYSTS
  The dollar's recent decline, despite
  massive central bank purchases, is a forceful reminder that
  official intervention in the foreign exchanges can work only if
  it is well-timed to coincide with shifts in market fundamentals
  or sentiment, dealers and analysts said.
      Central banks may succeed in slowing a trend, but, without
  accompanying policy changes, they stand little chance of
  reversing the direction of an ever-growing global market in
  which more than 200 billion dlrs is traded every day, the
  sources said.
      ""Timing and psychology are the key to successful
  intervention,"" said Jim O'Neill, a financial markets economist
  with Marine Midland Banks Inc. The importance of complementary
  changes in economic fundamentals was underlined yesterday when
  a change in interest rates boosted the dollar, instantly
  achieving what the central banks had tried in vain to do for a
  week through open market intervention.
      After Citibank raised its prime rate by a quarter-point to
  7-3/4 pct, the first change in the rate since last August, the
  dollar started to advance and reached a high in Tokyo of 147.50
  yen, up two yen from Tuesday's New York low.
      By contrast, monetary authorities spearheaded by the Bank
  of Japan are estimated to have bought as much as 10 billion
  dlrs in the last 10 days of March but could not prevent the
  dollar from skidding through 150 yen and plumbing a 40-year low
  Monday of 144.70 yen. Some experts worry the central banks have
  lost more than just a temporary battle to prop up the dollar.
  The market is wary of being caught wrong-footed by a central
  bank foray, but is no longer mesmerized.
      ""They've lost their credibility. The market feels it can
  take on the central banks and win,"" said Michael Snow, head of
  treasury operations at Union Bank of Switzerland in New York.
      The relative failure of recent intervention stands in sharp
  contrast to the success that central banks scored when they
  joined forces to drive the dollar down following the September
  22, 1985, Plaza accord.
      Then, however, central banks had an easy time of it,
  because the markets and the Treasuries of the major industrial
  powers were agreed that the dollar needed to head lower to
  redress massive worldwide trade imbalances.
      Now, there is no such consensus. The market is saying that
  the dollar must fall further because the U.S. trade deficit is
  showing little sign of improvement, while Japan is resisting in
  a bid to protect its export industries.
      For its part, the United States is apparently content to
  let the dollar fall gradually further and is paying little more
  than lip service to the February Paris agreement of the Group
  of Five plus Canada to foster stability, dealers say.
      Specifically, they said the Fed's dollar-buying
  intervention has been half-hearted, designed more as a
  political gesture to Japan than to strike fear into the
  markets. ""It's been pro-forma intervention,"" said Francoise
  Soares-Kemp, chief corporate trader at Credit Lyonnais.
      Because of this discord and the market's momentum for a
  lower dollar, analysts said intervention looks doomed to fail.
      ""It's going to take a lot more than the central banks to
  hold the dollar (at these levels),"" said Snow, who predicts
  another 10 to 15 pct depreciation.
      ""There have to be structural changes that occur to make the
  market stop selling dollars,"" added ""Buying six billion dollars
  in three weeks is not going to do it.""
      Late last decade during the presidency of Jimmy Carter,
  when the dollar was last under heavy speculative attack,
  central banks sometimes intervened to the tune of six billion
  dlrs in a single day but still failed to stop the dollar
  falling to a record low of 1.70 marks, analysts said.
      Snow said purchases on that scale now are unlikely. ""I
  don't think anybody has the stomach for it, because they saw
  the futility of it in the seventies.""
      Indeed, because the market has grown in leaps and bound
  since then, intervention on an even greater scale would
  probably be needed to impress the market.
      Trading volume in London, New York and Tokyo alone last
  year averaged nearly 188 billion dlrs a day, according to a
  joint central bank study, about double the previous estimate
  made just two years earlier by the Group of Thirty private
  research group.
      There are signs that central banks, too, realize the
  futility of swimming against the tide.
      Bank of Japan sources told Reuters in Tokyo earlier this
  week that they believed the limits of currency market
  intervention are perhaps being reached and that other methods
  for bolstering the dollar, such as invoking currency swap
  agreements with other central banks, are being considered.
      ""In this era of financial liberalization, it's almost
  impossible to control the flow of capital in and out of Japan,""
  one senior official in Tokyo said.

  Horn and Hardart Co said it
  disposed of 33 Bojangles' Chicken 'N Biscuits restaurants in
  Florida as part of its previously announced retrenchment of its
  Bojangles' subsidiary.
      Terms were not disclosed.
      The company said the restaurants in Orlando, Tampa and
  Jacksonville markets have incurred the majority of Bojangles'
  operating losses over the last two years.
      Due to the transaction, Horn and Hardart is projecting a
  positive cash flow for the unit for the remainder of fiscal
  1987.
      A spokesman said the disposition consists of a combination
  of sale, lease and re-franchise agreements.
      The transaction involves one-quarter of the company-owned
  Bojangles' restaurants and is in accordance with its
  restructuring program announced in October 1986.
      A spokesman said the company is considering the sale or
  spinoff of the 91-company owned additional restaurants, which
  are profitable.
      The company said the disposition will result in no profit
  or loss for the company because the costs were anticipated in a
  34-mln-dlr reserve taken in the third quarter of 1986.
      The foodservice division, which includes Burger King,
  Arby's and Tony Roma's, had a pre-tax operating loss of 29.6
  mln dlrs in 1986, including the 34.0 mln dlr charge to
  restructure Bojangles. Excluding Bojangles', the group had
  revenues of 43.8 mln dlrs.
      The company said that, pursuant to the restructuring, it
  has cut general and administrative expenses attributable to
  Bojangle' by 35 pct.

  Swire Pacific Ltd &lt;SWPC.HKG> expects
  continued growth in all divisions this year though it sees
  problems in the marine sector, chairman Michael Miles said.
      He told reporters:""1987 has started well for Cathay Pacific
  Airways which looks forward to another good year... Swire
  Properties expects further good results both from properties
  under development for sale and from its investment property
  portfolio.""
      He did not give any specific projections for earnings. The
  company earlier reported 46 pct higher 1986 net profits at 1.78
  billion H.K. Dlrs from a year ago.
      Swire also had an extraordinary profit of 1.38 billion dlrs
  mainly from the sale of a 15.25 pct interest in Cathay Pacific
  Airways Ltd &lt;CAPH.HKG>.
      Miles said the company will use the money to develop its
  business, primarily in Hong Kong.
      Swire's stake in Cathay was first reduced to 54.25 pct from
  70 pct when Cathay was publicly floated, and then cut to 50.25
  pct when Cathay issued new shares amounting to 12 pct of the
  enlarged capital to the state-owned &lt;China International Trust
  and Investment Corp>. Cathay last week reported its 1986
  profits rose to 1.23 billion dlrs from 777 mln a year ago.
      Miles said despite last year's rapid expansion in Cathay's
  flights and fleet, load factor is still holding up at 70 pct.
      He said Cathay's growth last year was the result of ""a
  marginal increase in the revenue load factor coupled with
  savings in fuel costs.""
      ""At present fuel prices are stable and will remain stable
  for the rest of this year,"" he said, ""though there might be a bit
  of increase later this year.''
      Miles said Swire is not abandoning its offshore oil service
  operations, even though the marine sector is generally
  depressed. ""Obviously the marine industry is not getting any
  better,"" he said.
      The real estate market remained strong and Swire last year
  revalued its property portfolio up 634 mln dlrs compared with
  an increase of 864.4 mln dlrs the previous year.
      Miles said he expects the property market to remain firm
  but said the firm has no available land for a major housing
  project such as its Taikoo Shing development on Hong Kong
  island now near completion.
      He said the company's 50 pct unit &lt;Hongkong United Dockyard
  Ltd> is negotiating with the government for the development of
  an existing petroleum storage depot into a major housing
  estate. ""But it's not as big as Taikoo Shing,"" he said.

  Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige
  said the United States would go ahead with planned 300 mln dlr
  sanctions against Japanese semiconductor exports, despite any
  U.S. Japanese talks to avert the trade curbs.
      He said in a speech to an export-import group that he was
  sure the United States and Japan could work out their dispute
  over unfair Japanese trade practices in semiconductor trade,
  but ""I am sure the sanctions will go in before we work it out.""
      Sanctions are to be imposed on April 17.
      He also said he did not think there would be a trade war
  with Japan, because Japan had too much value in exports to the
  United States to risk such a war.
      ""Those fears are unfounded,"" he said.
      He told reporters later that the sharp drop in the
  securities market was not due to fears of a trade war, but fear
  of inflation and that the Federal Reserve may act on that fact.
      Market reaction was also due, he said, to the drop in the
  value of the dollar, although trade issues did have some
  effect.
      Baldrige said that observers who were attributing the drop
  in the market to trade sanctions were ""barking up the wrong
  tree.""
      He said the market observers will realize this shortly.
      Baldrige said his remarks did not mean to suggest anything
  about the market or the exchange rate of the dollar.

  This week's Group of Seven (G-7) meeting in
  Washington provides an opportunity to verify an accord reached
  at the Tokyo summit last May to include Italy and Canada in
  Group of Five (G-5) talks on management of the international
  monetary system and related issues, the Italian Treasury said.
      It said in a statement the G-7 meeting, which Italy plans
  to attend, will provide a forum for considering the Tokyo
  accord in the light of events in Paris in February this year.
      On February 22, Italy boycotted a meeting in Paris of its
  G-7 partners - the United States, Japan, West Germany, France,
  Britain and Canada - after being excluded from an earlier
  session of talks involving G-5 members.
      Today's statement from the Italian Treasury said-
      ""Nobody denies the existence of G-5 but we should like it to
  be remembered that the Tokyo accords provided for the
  enlargement of the group to Italy and Canada whenever ""the
  management or the improvement of the international monetary
  economic policy measures are to be discussed or dealt with.'""
      Italy refused to attend the Paris G-7 meeting on the
  grounds that G-5, grouping the United States, Japan, West
  Germany, France and Britain, had reduced Italy's role to rubber
  stamping agreements already taken.
      The Italian Treasury said today that Italy was ""certain that

training/11234,"CALL MONEY PRESSURE FROM LARGE GERMAN BANKS
  One or two large West German banks
  effectively drained the domestic money market of liquidity at
  the end of the month in order to achieve higher rates from
  their overnight deposits, money dealers said.
      As a result, call money soared in active trading to around
  the Lombard rate of five pct from 3.70/80 pct yesterday as
  banks found themselves short of minimum reserve funds.
      Bundesbank figures showed that banks held an average daily
  51 billion marks in interest-free minimum reserve assets at the
  central bank over the first 29 days of the month.
      Though this was above the March requirement of 50.7
  billion, actual holdings at the weekend were 44.2 billion.
      To meet the daily average, dealers said, banks must raise
  holdings by two billion marks to 46.3 billion today and
  tomorrow. But liquidity was tight in early business because
  banks excessively took up the Bundesbank's offer for sale of
  Treasury bills on Friday. This provides a rate of 3.50 pct for
  three-day deposits and is an effective floor to the market.
      Though some liquidity, from bills bought on Thursday,
  flowed back into the market today, the bulk would not return
  until tomorrow, the start of the new month, dealers said.
      Dealers said the large banks, which they did not name,
  commanded short-term money requirements of as much as five
  billion marks or so.
      With a knowledge of their own needs until the end of the
  month, the banks bought excessive amounts of treasury bills,
  draining liquidity for three days. When other banks sought
  funds, rates rose and large banks were able to place excess
  funds on deposit at a considerably higher average return.
      One senior dealer said the Bundesbank, with advanced
  knowledge of the market's needs, should have curtailed its
  sales of treasury bills on Friday.
      Though dealers only late in the day learn of the total
  minimum reserve holdings of the previous day, the Bundesbank
  has an immediate overview of the situation and could anticipate
  the strength of demand for funds the following day, he said.
      ""(Bundesbank dealers) could easily have said we are not
  selling any treasury bills or we're not selling them in this
  amount,"" he said. ""If the Bundesbank wants to finely steer the
  market then they should avoid such excesses. Tomorrow it will
  be different. Call money will fall back to 4.0 pct or so.""
      But the Bundesbank would not approve of the sharp jump in
  rates, given the delicate state of currency markets.
      International central banks have been at pains to prevent a
  dollar fall against major currencies, including the mark.
  Dealers said a rise in call money gives the mark a firmer
  undertone, contributing to downward pressure on the dollar.
      ""The whole tender policy is to have a call money of between
  three and four pct. In that case the excesses as we have today
  cannot be very popular,"" the senior dealer said.
      Dealers said the large banks probably achieved average
  rates of return on their excess funds of between 3.75 pct or
  four pct. This is a higher return than they would have earned
  without the excessive draining through the treasury bill
  mechanism.
      Because of the currency situation and the wage negotiations
  between Germany's major employers and the unions, the
  Bundesbank would be very unlikely to make any changes to
  monetary policy at its council meeting on Thursday, they said.
      Bundesbank figures showed that banks fell back on the
  Lombard emergency funding facility to draw down 1.5 billion
  marks yesterday as rates began to tighten in late business.

  Responsibility for the appreciation of
  the Taiwan dollar and the South Korean Won lies soley with
  those countries, said U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter
      Speaking to the Asia Society, Yeutter said that it is in
  those countries' own long-term interest to raise the value of
  their currencies against the dollar.
      Yeutter was responding to a question about what the U.S.
  could do to encourage appreciation of those currencies against
  the dollar in order to reduce the large U.S. trade deficits
  with Taiwain and Korea.
      ""An undervalued currency will help those countries' exports
  in the short term, but in the long run they have to be
  concerned about how they are perceived in the international
  business community,"" Yeutter said.
      For Taiwan, Yeutter said that with its per capita trade
  surplus with the U.S., much larger than that of Japan's, and
  with huge foreign exchange reserves, it was difficult to defend
  the high import tarrifs and other barriers that prevail in that
  country.
      He also said that the south Korean Won should begin to move
  to reflect underlying economic fundamentals, ""otherwise in two
  or three years' time, Korea will be in the same situation that
  prevails in Taiwan.""
      Turning to the U.S. deficit with Japan of more than 50
  billion dlrs, Yeutter said that this situation was not
  sustainable.
      ""Something must give soon. If not, there is a great threat
  of U.S. legislative action to counteract that trend,"" Yeutter

training/8746,"U.S. ECONOMY SHOWS PROMISING SIGNS OF GROWTH
  The U.S. economy is showing some
  promising signs of accelerated expansion despite the
  sluggishness of the fourth quarter last year, private
  economists say.
      Some of the slowness experienced in the October-December
  period had been expected to spill over into the first quarter
  this year, as the tax law changes that went into effect in
  January slowed business and consumer spending.
      But some of the latest economic data show signs of
  surprising strength in the U.S. economy, although some
  economists remain cautious about the outlook.
      The Commerce Department reported today that new orders for
  durable goods in February jumped by 5.7 billion dlrs, a six pct
  rise, to 101.2 billion dlrs. Even excluding volatile defense
  goods, durable goods orders rose a healthy 3.8 pct, the agency
  said.
      The February numbers surpassed the expectations of many
  financial analysts, whose predictions ranged from flat to
  increases of up to five pct.
      The January/February employment statistics suggest the
  Gross National Product will show a healthy rate of growth for
  the first three months of this year, said Lyle Gramley, an
  economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association.
      The U.S. jobless rate in February and January was 6.7 pct,
  the lowest rate since March 1980. The number of new non-farm
  jobs rose by 337,000 in February after a 319,000 gain in
  January and a 225,000 December increase, the government said.
      The employment data suggests a GNP annual growth rate of
  about three to 3.25 pct in the first quarter, said Gramley.
      Much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuilding
  their inventories and is not likely to be sustained in the
  second quarter, Gramley said. He expects a slowdown in the
  second quarter with smaller increases in personal consumption
  and government spending. He also sees residential construction
  declining mostly for multi-family housing units.
      Fidelity Bank senior economist Mickey Levy said some of the
  fourth quarter slowness will continue.
      Levy predicts GNP will grow at a scant 1.5 pct rate in the
  first quarter of 1987, accelerate during the second quarter and
  show a brisk 4.5 pct annual rate in the third quarter.
      The key to both forecasts is a marked improvement in the
  U.S. trade balance which is expected because of the decline in
  the dollar's value over the last year and half.
      ""The improvement will be gradual and long lasting,"" Levy
  predicted. Most of it will be through import reduction, but at
  least one-third will be due to a rise in product exports as the
  prices of U.S. goods become more attractive overseas.
      The Reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit,
  which soared to record levels last year, will improve this year
  and the U.S. economy will grow by a respectable 3.2 pct for the
  year compared with a 2.5 pct rate last year.
      As part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit, the U.S.
  has been pressing West Germany and Japan to stimulate their
  domestic demand for goods from the U.S. and others.
      U.S. officials believe that would help take some of the
  pressure off the United States whose five years of economic
  growth has been the mainstay of developing countries.
      The U.S. economy provided them with a giant market for
  their goods giving them a way to earn income badly needed to
  service their foreign debt.
      The government last week said the U.S. economy grew at a
  modest 1.1 pct annual rate during the fourth quarter.
      There were indications of improvement in the huge imbalance
  between the volume of goods imported to the United States and
  those shipped abroad. The report showed a rising volume of
  exports corresponding to a decline in imports despite the fact
  that in current dollar terms, the U.S. trade deficit worsened
  during the closing three months of 1986.
      While fourth quarter economic growth was weak, corporate
  profits jumped a healthy 6.1 pct during the period, the
  government said. It also reported that inflation, as measured
  by the GNP price deflator, remained in check, growing a
  moderate 0.7 pct in the period, the lowest rise in 19 years.
      The government also reported that consumer spending, a key
  element of the five year economic recovery, jumped 1.7 pct in
  February, after falling two pct in January.
      The Federal Reserve Board also reported that the
  manufacturing sector, which had been one of the weaker elements
  of the U.S. economy, was showing signs of recovery.
      In its latest report on current economic conditions, the
  Fed said that economic activity in the various regions of the
  country ranged from uneven or steady to improving.
  Manufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in most
  regions except Dallas where orders remained sluggish.
      Chase Econometrics Chairman Lawrence Chimerine said the
  pick up in the U.S. manufacturing sector is largely due to the
  drop in the dollar's value. He said he does not foresee a major
  pick up in economic activity, but does not believe the economy
  will slip into recession either.
      He said higher prices on imported products and wage cuts
  that have helped the manufacturing sector will squeeze
  consumers purchasing power.
      ""That pattern is starting and will continue for a number of
  years,"" Chimerine said. He sees economic growth hovering around
  a modest two pct level for the next few years.

  The House Ways and Means Committee
  completed action on legislation to toughen U.S. trade laws,
  chairman Dan Rostenkowski said.
      The committee's consideration of one of the most
  controversial provisions, a plan to force major trade surplus
  countries to cut their trade imbalance with the United States,
  was deferred until the full House considers the trade bill, its
  sponsor Rep. Richard Gephardt said.
      Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, told Reuters he was not
  certain the exact form his trade surplus reduction proposal
  would take. Last year the House approved his plan to force a 10
  pct surplus cutback each year for four years, by countries such
  as Japan.
      The Ways and Means Committess' trade bill forces President
  Reagan to retaliate against unfair trade practices that violate
  international trade agreements but it allows him to wave
  retaliatory tariffs or quotas if the action would hurt the U.S.
  economy.
      The trade bill gives U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
  Yeutter more authority in trade negotiations and in decisions
  to grant domestic industries import relief.
      It also gives him authority to decide whether foreign trade
  practices are unfair and violate U.S. trading rights. These
  powers are currently held by President Reagan.
      The administration has strongly objected to this transfer
  of authority from Reagan to Yeutter.
      The bill also extends U.S. authority to negotiate
  multilateral trade agreements. The bill will be wrapped into
  other trade legislation and voted on in the House in April.

  The Securities and Exchange
  Commission (SEC) staff is seeking authority to take enforcement
  action against Allegheny International Inc, the
  Pittsburgh-based industrial and consumer products firm said.
      Allegheny made the disclosure in documents filed with the
  SEC in connection with its recent agreement to be taken private
  through a leveraged buyout led by First Boston Inc.
      ""Following announcement of the merger agreement, the company
  was informed by the Enforcement Division of the (SEC) that it
  intends to seek authority from the commission to institute a
  proceeding against the company,"" Allegheny said.
      ""The company is cooperating in the commission's
  investigation which is continuing and now includes the taking
  of testimony of employes and others,"" Allegheny said.
      In the ongoing probe, Allegheny said, the staff has asked
  for information about company executive compensation and
  benefit plans, certain company-owned real estate, travel and
  entertainment spending and the use of corporate aircraft.
      It also has asked for information on acquisitions and
  divestitures, the company's accounting system ""and other
  internal controls,"" Allegheny said.
     The probe began in February 1986, Allegheny said.
      The SEC, as a matter of policy, routinely declines comment
  on its enforcement actions.
      The SEC investigation began just months before Allegheny
  became the target of a series of shareholder lawsuits claiming
  that the company had violated the federal securities laws by
  failing to disclose material matters in recent annual proxy
  statements.
      The suits, later consolidated into a single class-action
  complaint before a Pennsylvania federal court, allege
  securities law violations involving numerous current and former
  Allegheny officers and directors.
      Earlier this month, lawyers for the shareholders asked the
  court to expand the charges to include an allegation that, in
  the buyout, Allegheny had attempted to illegally freeze out its
  public shareholders at an unfair price.
      Allegheny said it intends to vigorously defend itself
  against all charges.
      The charges made in the shareholder suits are widely
  believed to have led to last summer's resignation of Chairman
  and Chief Executive Officer Robert Buckley.
      In the buyout, a group led by First Boston tendered March
  13 for all outstanding Allegheny shares at 24.60 dlrs a share.

  The British government may revoke the
  licences of selected Japanese banks and securities companies
  operating in London's financial City when they come up for
  renewal next summer if progress is not made towards opening up
  Japan's markets to foreign competition, government sources
  said.
      ""We can't say ""yes, we are going to do it (revoke licences)""
  but this is definitely being considered,"" an official said.
      His comments came after the government was formally urged
  today by a cross-section of influential MPs to take joint
  retaliatory action with the United States against Japan.
      Britain has grown increasingly impatient with Japanese
  trade practices. ""There's a sense of urgency here now, but the
  emphasis is on securing - not undermining - our interests in
  Japan,"" another government official told Reuters.
      Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said on Thursday that
  Britain would not hesitate to use new powers contained in the
  Financial Services Act 1986 and the Banking Bill to retaliate
  against countries that do not offer reciprocal market access.
      She clearly had Japan in mind, government sources said.
      The U.K. Last year showed a trade defict with Japan of 3.7
  billion stg, official figures show.
      A parliamentary motion, signed by 98 MPs, today urged the
  U.K. Government to ""coordinate action with the President of the
  United States, and through the Department of Trade and
  Industry, to suspend all further applications from Japanese
  communications companies for equipment approval by the British
  Approvals Board for Telecommunications, and all further
  applications from Japanese financial institutions for licences""
  until authorities in Japan stopped imposing what the MPs called
  ""restrictive conditions"" on the bid by (Cable and Wireless PLC)
  (cawl.L) and its U.S. And Japanese partners for a stake in
  Japan's international telecommunications market.
      The motion for retaliatory steps came from a cross-section
  of MPs, reflecting the strength of feeling inside Parliament.
  Parliamentarians said their action would increase pressure on
  the Conservative government to take firm action.
      Officials said another option now being considered by the
  U.K. Is to refuse issuing new banking licences to Japanese
  institutions. That could be done under the government's
  proposed Banking Bill now moving through parliament.
      58 Japanese financial institutions are authorised to deal
  in London, of which 29 are banks. In Tokyo, 14 London-based
  firms are authorised to do financial business, officials said.
      The new financial services and banking acts offer Britain
  an alternative for retaliation which would be otherwise denied
  under legally-binding international trade agreements.
      ""The Financial Services Act gives (Trade and Industry
  Secretary Paul) Channon power to stop firms from engaging in
  investment, banking and insurance,"" one official said.
      ""This point has been made to the Japanese at official level
  a number times,"" the official added.
      Britain and France are now working together to urge that
  the European Community take collective action against Japan,
  but by working within EC treaties, another official said.
      British Trade Minister Alan Clark said this week in a radio
  interview that the European Community should build barriers
  against Japanese imports through certification procedures
  similar to those facing European exporters in Japan.
      ""There comes a point where you cannot resist any longer,"" he
  said, adding ""(such barriers) can't be put in place overnight.""
  Clark said the issue of reciprocity regarding visible trade
  ""strikes at the basis of whether British industry is to have a
  fair access to an extremely large market (Japan) which is
  itself in a very dominant position (in) certain aspects of our
  own domestic market ... It is really a question of fairness.""
      The situation is only likely to worsen following news that
  Japan's trade surplus with the rest of the world rose by more
  than 70 pct in February, year-on-year, to 8.14 billion dlrs
  from 5.7 billion in January, political sources said.
      But Clark said in his interview that the issues of visible
  trade and access to financial markets should be kept separate.
      Should Britain decide to act against Japanese financial
  institutions, it would most likely focus on the smaller, rather
  than larger ones, to minimise any risks to its role as a global
  business centre, government sources said. Japan's four largest
  securities houses are members of the London Stock Exchange.
      In Washington, White House officials said President Reagan
  was ready to impose retaliatory trade action against Japan for
  breaking its semiconductor agreement with the United States.
      There was no immediate indication when Reagan might act on
  the recommendations of his Economic Policy Council to curb
  Japanese exports to the United States but officials said the
  move could come today or early next week.
      Trade sources said the actions being weighed by Reagan
  included tariffs on a wide variety of Japanese exports which
  use semiconductors.

  Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita
  said the central bank has no intention of cutting its discount
  rate again as a way of preventing the yen's rise.
      He told a press conference that the growth of Japanese
  money supply remains high.
      The bank will have to watch closely various developments
  resulting from its already eased monetary stance, such as the
  sharp rise in real estate and stock prices, he said.
      Although the yen's rise will have a greater deflationary
  impact on the economy, the economy is not likely to slow down
  much further, Sumita said.
      ""I don't think we should change our economic outlook at the
  moment,"" Sumita said.
      Sumita has said in the past that he expects the economy to
  show a gradual upturn in the second half of the year.
      The governor said the six major industrial nations are
  expected to review last month's pact on currency stability when
  they meet next in April.
      Dealers said they expect the six - Britain, Canada, France,
  Japan, the U.S. Amd West Germany - to meet just before the

training/3429,"USSR SEEN LIKELY TO HONOR CORN COMMITMENT
  The Soviet Union will likely honor
  its commitment with the United States to buy a minimum of four
  mln tonnes of corn this year, an Agriculture Department
  official said.
      ""They have always honoured the agreement, and there's no
  reason now to think they won't this year,"" he told Reuters.
      ""They have an aggressive buying campaign from the European
  Community, from Canada, from the U.S. They're active buyers
  from all sources at this point,"" the official said in
  explaining why the Department raised its Soviet grain imports
  estimate today by three mln tonnes to 26 mln tonnes.
      This is a dramatic shift from just a few months ago when
  analysts were saying the USSR might not buy any U.S. corn for
  the first time in 15 years.
      A drawdown of corn supplies in China and Argentina, concern
  over Soviet winter crops, and increasing competition for U.S.
  corn were all cited as possible factors in creating Moscow's
  recent interest.
      Lower corn production prospects in some major supplying
  countries have stirred activity from big buyers such as Japan,
  and the Soviets are also closely watching the situation, the
  official said.
      ""The Soviets will try to out-capitalize the capitalists""
  and buy corn before prices get too high, the official said. ""As
  soon as they need corn, they'll buy it,"" he added.
      USDA has confirmed one mln tonnes of corn sold to the
  Soviet Union, but both U.S. and Soviet analysts have said the
  purchases stand at 1.5 mln tonnes.
      The USDA official would not speculate on when the Soviets
  would enter the U.S. market again.
      ""There has definitely been an evolving mind set -- from the
  situation of slow grain buying a couple months ago to one of
  frenetic buying now,"" the official said.
      However, the situation in wheat is ""a different story,"" he
  said. Greater world supplies of wheat, heavier Soviet purchase
  commitments and less competitive U.S. wheat prices make Soviet
  purchases of U.S. wheat less likely, he said.
      Speculation has continued for several days that the U.S.
  is considering making an export bonus wheat subsidy offer to
  the Soviets, but U.S. officials have provided no confirmation.

training/13266,"IEA FORECASTS SLOWER GROWTH IN OECD OIL DEMAND
  Growth in oil consumption in the Western
  industrialized countries is likely to slow to around one pct
  this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International
  Energy Agency said.
      Oil use in the 24 member countries of the Organization for
  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) increased by around
  one pct in the first quarter of 1987 to 35.9 mln barrels a day,
  the IEA said in its latest monthly report.
      Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from
  transport fuels, as was the case in 1986. But if average
  consumer prices are higher than 1986, the rate of growth for
  these fuels may be below last year's 3.6 pct.
      The IEA said assuming crude and product prices remain nar
  current levels, some destocking by end-users can be expected.
      If that takes place, natural gas will also regain some of
  the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, it said.
      IEA estimates on April one put oil stocks held in the OECD
  area at 428 mln tonnes, or 98 days of forward consumption. This
  is about the same as at the begining of the year.
      The agency said this flat trend is explained by the
  projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of
  the year which offset a reduction in stocks.
      Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes
  on April one this year compared with 316 mln tonnes in calender
  1986 while governments also built up their strategic stocks to
  102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in 1986.
      The year-on-year trend of government stock building is
  continuing with company stocks rising, more or less in line
  with consumption, after declining for five years, IEA said.
      Oil stocks on land in the United States and Canada were put
  at 206.6 mln tonnes down from the 214 mln tonnes on January one
  and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption, respectively.
      Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes, down
  from the 154 mln tonnes on January one but still equivalent to
  94 days of consumption.
      The IEA said that initial estimates indicate that company
  stocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first
  quarter of the year. This followed a small rise in January of
  400,000 bpd but a decline of 1.5 bpd in February and 2.5 bpd in
  March.
      And it is possible that final data will show a larger draw,
  particulary for March, it said.
      As crude production also fell, there is likely to have also
  been a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, the
  IEA said.
      World oil supply fell through the first quarter by about
  two bpd to 45.2 bpd from 47.5 bpd in the last quarter of 1986.
      This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude
  production to around 15.5 bpd in February/March from 16.5 bpd
  in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from Centrally
  Planned Economies, the IEA said.
      Total OPEC oil supply totalled 17.2 bpd in the first
  quarter of 1987 compare with 19.3 bpd in the last three months
  of 1986 while supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 bpd as
  against 28.2 bpd in the same 1986 period.
      A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast
  3.3 bpd in march from 3.6 bpd in February was the largest
  factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA said.

      TWA said it may acquire additional shares in the open

      TWA has offered 52 dlrs per share for USAir Group. USAir

training/6876,"DIVISION SEEN ON HOW TO HELP U.S. OIL INDUSTRY
  The U.S. Congress and the oil industry
  are deeply divided on ways the government should assist the
  industry, hurt by the sharp fall in oil prices, and the
  subsequent growth in oil imports, industry analysts said.
      ""The industry is deeply divided between those who support an
  oil tariff and those who believe tax incentives are better,""
  said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy Research
  Associates, which recently completed a survey of the U.S.
  Congress on energy issues.
      Yergin said he saw mounting support within Congress for tax
  incentives rather than an oil tariff or import fee.
      Today U.S. Energy Secretary John Herington said he will
  propose tax incentives to increase edomestic oil and natural
  gas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for
  consideration. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
  proposal would be reviewed.
      Herrington said, ""I would like to shoot for one mln barrels
  a day (addition) to U.S. production."" U.S. oil output was off to
  8.4 mln bpd in the week of March 13, down six pct from last
  year, the American Petroleum Institute said.
      Oil industry analysts have forecast oil prices to average
  about 18 dlrs a barrel for the year and many believe that a
  move above that level will be unlikey for the near term.
      Paul Mlotok, oil analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc said that
  ""even with the rise in prices for the last week or two we've
  only altered our average price scenerio to about 17.50 dlrs for
  the year.""
      Analysts said that at that price renewed drilling and
  exploration to reverse the decline in U.S. crude oil output
  will not take place as the companies are waiting for stable
  prices over 20 dlrs to renew exploration.
      John Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry
  Research Foundation Inc in New york in recent testimony to
  Congress said ""The continuing decline in U.S. oil production is
  virtually inevitable under any realistic price scenario. But
  the future rate of decline is very much a function of world oil
  prices and U.S. government policy.""
      Lichtbalu said that tax breaks could be used to raise oil
  production but would only work over time.
      ""Lowering the producing industry's tax burden would probably
  be a slower stimulant (to output) than a price increase but
  would not raise energy costs."" Lichtblau said.
      But the small independent oil companies who do much of the
  drilling in the U.S. are looking for the more immediate relief
  which could be brought on by an oil import fee.
      Ronald Tappmeyer, president of the International
  Association of Drilling Contractors, said, ""The members of our
  trade asssociation are convinced that only a variable oil
  import fee that sets a minimum price trigger can protect our
  nation."" The association represents some 1,300 drilling and oil
  service companies.
      The CERA survey of Congress shows that the oil import fee
  will face a stiff uphill battle.
      Yergin said that the poll which was conducted in January by
  a former Congressman, Orval Hansen, showed support for the oil
  import fee from 22 pct of the Congressmen surveyed largely as a
  means of protecting the domestic petroleum industry.
       At the same time 48 pct of the Congressmen surveyed
  opposed the fee with the respondents saying the tariff would
  hurt consumers and some regional interests.
      But 80 pct of the sample said support for a fee could grow
  if production continued to fall and imports to rise.
      Yergin said that imports above 50 pct of U.S. requirements
  ""is a critical, symbolic level. If they (imports) move above
  that level, a fee may not be legislated but there will
  certainly be pressure for some form of action.""
       But Lichtblau, in a telephone interview, said, ""a 50 pct
  rate of import dependency is not likely to happen before 1990.
      In 1986 U.S. oil imports rose to 33 pct of u.s. energy
  requirements and shopuld be about 34 pct in 1987, he added.

training/342,"JAPAN, U.S. SET TO BEGIN HIGH-LEVEL TRADE TALKS
  Japan and the U.S. Kick off top-level
  trade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are
  growing increasingly irritated with each other.
      The talks, held annually at sub-cabinet level to review the
  whole gamut of U.S./Japan economic relations, will pave the way
  for American Secretary of State George Schultz's one day
  stop-over here at end-week on his way home from China.
      Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure,
  the U.S. Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action to
  reduce its still huge trade surplus, U.S. Officials said.
      ""We appreciate their frustration,"" a senior Japanese
  government official said. ""But we are also frustrated.""
      The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last
  18 months has hit Japan hard, forcing exporters to slash
  spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad.
  That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade,
  but it will, he said.
      He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progress
  that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that
  remain when it talks with Congress.
      ""It would only take five minutes to list their
  accomplishments,"" a senior U.S. Official replied.
      The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the
  economic structures of both countries and how they affect the
  bilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48
  billion dlrs in Japan's favour.
      On the following two days, the topics will range from
  multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the General
  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral trade
  problems as super computers.
      The structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling
  discussions among senior officials. Tomorrow's topics include
  savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and
  housing, and the implications of government budget deficits.
      These talks come at a particularly delicate time for the
  Japanese government, which is facing increasing domestic
  pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and
  stimulate the sagging economy by spending more.
      Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention of
  boosting domestic demand and imports, as Washington wants.
      Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge
  U.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade
  imbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Is
  buying more imports.
      Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft
  trade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial
  trade practices. ""It condemns Japan without due process,"" one
  Japanese official said.
      That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out
  bill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen, he said.
      Japan is also not totally happy with the administration's
  trade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal
  access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade
  action by the U.S., Officials said.
      Nevertheless, Japanese officials said they remain in a weak
  bargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade bill
  overhanging them.
      ""We have no leverage,"" one official admitted.
      As a result, Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaints
  about its trade practices in a variety of fields, including
  super computers.
      The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanese
  super computer market.
      The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to
  public institutions like universities which buy the
  sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up

  Prospects for renewal of the

  the Soviet Union, high U.S. commodity prices, and increased

  next year less certain, Albert Melnikov, deputy trade
  representative of the Soviet Union, said in an interview.
      The current agreement expires on Sept 30, 1988.
      Melnikov said that world grain markets are different than
  when the first agreement was signed in 1975.
      Statements from both U.S. and Soviet officials have
  indicate that a long term grains agreement might not be as
  attractive for both sides as it once was.
      ""We have had one agreement. We have had a second agreement,
  but with the second agreement we've had difficulties with
  prices,"" Melnikov said.
      ""I cannot give you any forecasts in response to the future
  about the agreement.... I do not want to speculate on what will
  happen after Sept 30, 1988,"" he said.
      Melnikov noted that he has seen no indications from Soviet

  of the agreement.

training/3020,"POEHL SAYS FURTHER RATE CUT POSSIBLE - SOURCES
  Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl
  told a closed investment symposium that West Germany could cut
  leading interest rates again if the United States makes a
  similar move, banking sources said.
      The sources were reporting Poehl's remarks at a symposium
  in Duesseldorf last week organised by Deutsche Bank Ag. Press
  representatives were not invited.
      The sources, speaking separately, said Poehl told about 200
  bankers in reply to questions that a cut in U.S. Interest rates
  would give room for a matching measure in Germany.
      ""It was a definite hint at lower German interest rates,"" said
  one banker who attended the symposium.
      A Bundesbank spokesman said the central bank would have no
  comment on the reported remarks, made at the private meeting.
      But, according to a second source, who also declined to be
  identified, Poehl's comments were seen by bankers present as a
  direct pointer to further moves by the central bank to defend
  German industry from an additional revaluation of the mark.
      ""He said if the Americans drop their interest rates then the
  Bundesbank would also drop them. He said that quite clearly,""
  the second source said.
      In reply to questions, Poehl also said the half-point cut
  in the discount and Lombard rates on January 22 came after the
  U.S. Had signalled it would be prepared to attend a meeting to
  discuss the level of the dollar on condition Germany made such
  a move in advance, the sources said.
      Asked if American authorities could have been persuaded, by
  cuts in German rates, to come to the bargaining table as early
  as last September, one of the sources quoted Poehl as saying,
  ""No, they wouldn't have been. We checked that.""
      The Paris meeting of the Group of Six industrial nations
  took place exactly one month after the German cut in rates.
      Poehl emphasised in his comments the very close talks
  between central banks before and after the G-6 meeting, saying
  that financial markets had not fully realised the significance
  of the Paris session and the U.S. Agreement to stem further
  falls in the value of the dollar, the sources said.
      For the first time all participants at the summit agreed
  that a further fall in the dollar would be harmful for all
  world economies, including the U.S., Poehl had said.
      The sources said the tone of Poehl's comments boosted
  growing sentiment that the dollar would be stabilised around
  current levels by international central bank cooperation.
      One source said Poehl's remarks also underlined the fact
  that the Bundesbank was now more prepared to be accommodative
  in monetary policy in order to prevent a further slowdown in
  West Germany's economic growth.
      Poehl and other Bundesbank officials have in the past
  stressed that the German central bank had no direct
  responsibility for growth and was solely concerned with
  combatting inflation.
      This led, for instance, to the introduction of a tighter
  monetary stance from the beginning of December until the
  half-point cut in rates in late January.
      The sources quoted Poehl as saying that the current
  overshooting of the German monetary target would not directly
  respark inflation. The Bundesbank was not obliged to react
  immediately whenever such overshooting occurs.
      Latest data for central bank money stock, the Bundesbank's
  main measure of money supply, showed the measure was growing at
  7-1/2 pct in January, outside its three to six pct 1987 target.
      Share prices rose in very active trading today, with
  dealers reporting that Poehl's remarks, coupled with a bullish

training/8974,"CPC &lt;CPC> TO SELL EUROPEAN BUSINESS
  CPC International Inc said it reached
  an agreement in principle to sell its European corn wet milling
  business to Agricola Finanziaria SpA, a member of the Ferruzzi
  Group, for a price in excess of 600 mln dlrs.
      The transaction is expected to be completed by September
  30.
      CPC said it expects no material gain or loss this year from
  the transaction. But the effect of the deal on 1987 earnings
  can be evaluated in full only when the definitive pacts are
  completed, it said.
      The long-term effect of the transaction on CPC's earnings
  should be positive, it added, as it will allow capital
  expenditures to be cut back and will reduce corporate and
  divisional overheads as well as operating expenses in the
  European business.
      The sale is an important part of a restructuring announced
  in November, CPC said.
      Proceeds of the sale will be used to reduce debt incurred
  in the purchase of the Arnold Foods and Old London specialty
  baking businesses and the stock repurchase program that was 
  part of the restructuring.
      As of December 31, CPC had bought about 15 mln of its
  common shares, adjusted for a 2-for-1 split in January, for a
  total cost of 621.8 mln dlrs, according to its 1986 annual
  report.
      In December, CPC acquired Arnold Foods and Old London for a
  total of about 170 mln dlrs.
      CPC had previously said it wanted to sell the European corn
  wet milling business and use the proceeds to help reduce debt,
  including that incurred under the share buyback.
      In total, CPC has bought back about 16 mln shares of common
  stock, adjusted for the split, it said today. In November it
  authorized a buyback of 20 mln shares, adjusted for the split.
      The buyback and the restructuring were triggered in
  November, after companies controlled by Ronald Perelman,
  chairman of Revlon Group Inc &lt;REV>, acquired about 7.6 pct of
  CPC's then outstanding stock.
      In 1986, the European corn wet milling business had sales
  of 914.1 mln dlrs, operating income before overheads of 68.8
  mln dlrs and associated headquarters overhead costs of 19.7 mln
  dlrs, according to CPC's 1986 annual report.
      The businesses' assets were 645.7 mln dlrs in 1986, the
  report said.

training/10375,"INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS TO CUT TRADE GAP
  India is searching for non-communist
  countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and
  conserve foreign exchange.
      Wheat, tobacco, tea, coffee, jute, engineering and
  electronic goods, as well as minerals including iron ore, are
  all on offer in return for crude oil, petroleum products,
  chemicals, steel and machinery, trade sources told Reuters.
      Most of the impetus behind countertrade, which began in
  1984, comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading
  Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).
      ""The two state trading corporations are free to use their
  buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian
  exports,"" a commerce ministry spokeswoman said, adding that
  private firms are excluded from countertrading.
      One trade source said India has targetted countries that
  depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign
  imports.
      However, countertrade deals still make up only a small part
  of India's total trading and are likely to account for less
  than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade
  during the nine months ended December, the sources said.
      Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India's 25.65
  billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March,
  against almost nothing in 1984/85, official figures show.
      However, the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern
  Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees, the sources said.
      Total trade with the Soviet Union, involving swaps of
  agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude
  oil, is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87,
  against three billion in 1985/86.
      Indian countertrade, which is being promoted mainly to help
  narrow the country's large trade deficit, is still
  insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia,
  Venezuela and Brazil, the trade sources said.
      The trade deficit, which hit an estimated record 6.96
  billion dlrs in 1985/86, is expected to decline to 5.6 billion
  in the current fiscal year.
      But the push to include non-communist countries in
  countertrade is also due to other factors, including the slow
  growth of foreign reserves, a tight debt repayment schedule,
  shrinking aid and trade protectionism, businessmen said.
      One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting
  countertrade deals than in the past, when the deals were made
  discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the
  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), India cannot
  officially support bartering.
      The MMTC's recent countertrade deals include iron ore
  exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails.
      ""MMTC's recent global tenders now include a clause that
  preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind
  for goods and services sold to India,"" a trade official said,
  adding that the policy remains flexible.
      ""We also take into account other factors such as prices at
  which the goods and services are offered to India,"" the trade
  official said.
      Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign
  companies interested in selling aircraft, ships, drilling rigs
  and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance
  if they bought Indian goods or services in return, the trade
  sources said.
      Illustrating the point, the official said a South Korean
  firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln
  dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission.

training/12848,"IMF, WORLD BANK TO MEET AMID NEW INFLATION FEARS
  Amid new concerns about inflation,
  interest rate increases and trade confrontations,
  finance ministers and central bankers meet next week to discuss
  a deteriorating global debt and economic situation.
      The meetings, under the auspices of the International
  Monetary Fund and World Bank, come as interest rates are
  turning higher and the already-weak dollar has sunk further,
  upsetting bond and stock markets.
      Uncertainty is growing about the vitality of the global
  economy and whether the heavily-indebted countries can continue
  to carry the burden of their growing debt without vast new
  assistance.
      Monetary and diplomatic sources said there are no signs
  any new debt initiative of the sort that Treasury Secretary
  James Baker unveiled 18 months ago in Seoul is in the works.
      The strategy has drawn a serious challenge from Brazil,
  which suspended interest payments on 67 billion dlrs of
  commercial bank debt last month. The Banks have responded by
  laying the groundwork for writing down Brazilian loans.
      Separately, French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, in a
  visit earlier this week with President Reagan, sounded out the
  administration on a plan to funnel worldwide grain surpluses to
  the very poorest states.
      The French plan is certain to be discussed by the ministers
  in detail during next week's meetings and will undoubtedly be
  embraced by the developing countries.
      ""There's interest on the part of some countries for looking
  at the support of the special problems of the very poorest
  countries, because their position is so extreme,"" a Reagan
  administration official said.
      He suggested Washington was open to disussing the issue.
      The meetings will also assess the success of the Baker debt
  initiative, which called for new funding to help debtor
  countries grow out of their problems.
      The largest industrial countries have been attempting to
  coordinate economic policy in the hope of controlling the
  decline of the dollar, U.S. trade and budget deficits and other
  problems.
      At the same time, the industrial countries see little
  evidence of a strengthening of economic activity and the Fund
  forecasts they will grow 2.5 pct.
      The United States sees 3.2 pct growth for itself, 
  continuing its expansion for a fifth year, and has asked other
  industrial countries to stimulate their economies.
      These issues directly affect the debt problem and the
  ability of the debtor countries to grow out of their
  difficulties.
      In recent years, U.S. markets have absorbed the exports of
  developing country, allowing them to earn critical foreign
  exchange. But the United States wants to cut its trade deficit,
  running at a record 169.8 billion dlrs, and is pressing others
  to import more from developing countries.
      The discussions, from April six to 10, will be
  wide-ranging, touching everything from interest rates to the
  impact of development loans on the environment, according to
  monetary sources.
      The talks will include an examination of trade
  protectionist pressures in the wake of a decision by the Reagan
  administration to place some 300 mln dlrs in tariffs on
  microchip products from Japan, the sources said.
      The move accelerated the dollar's decline as financial
  markets grew alarmed that trade war was in the offing.
      There is concern that the action, prompted by U.S. charges
  that Japan has been selling computer chip products below fair
  market value and has kept its own market closed to imports,
  further undermining the international trading system.
      At the same time, the ministers will discuss the
  fundamental price weakness in basic commodities, the export
  mainstay of many developing countries.
      The so-called Group of Five industrial countries -- the
  United States, Japan, West Germany, France and Britain -- will
  gather for the first time since their February talks in Paris,
  where they agreed to keep the dollar from sliding further.
      The Five will be joined later by Italy and Canada for
  further debate on economic policy coordination.
      As part of the Paris accord, surplus countries such as
  Japan agreed to stimulate their economies, while America
  said it would reduce its federal budget deficit.
      Other major issues of the meetings include a U.S. bid to to
  have a larger say in approving loans of the Inter-American
  Development Bank, strengthening the link between loans and
  economic policy changes in debtor nations.
      Washington is also pressing the World Bank to take more
  account of the environment when making loan for dams and other
  projects.
      The new head of the Bank, Barber Conable, has said this
  issue is being reviewed and will be part of a reorganization
  plan for the Bank, now being prepared.

  The speaker of the Iranian Parliament,

  were available to escort Kuwaiti tankers through the waterway.
      ""If U.S. Intervention occurs, the entire world will become
  insecure for the Americans and the events of Lebanon could be
  repeated for the Americans everywhere,"" he said.
      U.S. Defence officials disclosed in Washington yesterday
  that the U.S. Navy, which has about 24 warships in or near the
  Gulf, was prepared to escort Kuwaiti tankers, regular targets
  for Iranian attacks in an offshoot of its war with Iraq.
      Rafsanjani, in an interview reported by the Iranian news
  agency IRNA, also commented on earlier U.S. Disclosures that
  Iran had erected sites for new Chinese-made Silkworm
  anti-shipping missiles at the Strait of Hormuz.
      The agency, received in London, quoted him as saying that
  Iran did not need missiles to close the strait, 24 miles wide
  at its narrowest, because ""we can close it with artillery only.""
      He added ""We have the longest coasts and the highest
  interest here and the small southern (Gulf) states have a

  Abu Dhabi's offshore Abu al-Bukhoosh
  oilfield in the Gulf, shut since an aerial attack last
  November, will reopen when new anti-aircraft defences are
  ready, and this could be in the next two months, oil industry
  sources said.
      They said the Abu Dhabi government and Compagnie Francaise
  des Petroles (Total) &lt;TPN.PA>, whose Total Abu al-Bukhoosh
  subsidiary owns 51 pct of the field, have agreed on the
  reopening, but that a date has not been definitely fixed.
      Unidentified planes hit the field, 100 miles off Abu Dhabi,
  last November 25.
      The raid killed eight workers and destroyed the main living
  quarters and a bridge linking a wellhead to the main production
  platform.
      Western diplomats in the region say Iran was responsible
  but Tehran has blamed its Gulf War enemy Iraq.
      Abu al-Bukhoosh was producing 57,000 barrels per day (bpd)
  at the time of the attack, but the sources said it would resume
  at a maximum of half that level because of reduced staff and
  the fact only four of five wellheads were now operable.
      The sources said only 80 personnel can be housed in
  remaining accomodations, the sources said.
      Facilities being installed to protect the field include
  aircraft detection equipment, anti-aircraft missiles, housing
  for military personnel and helicopter landing pads, the sources
  said.
      Abu Dhabi is the largest oil producer in the United Arab
  Emirates, accounting for about 800,000 bpd of its total 1.15
  mln bpd production, the sources said.
      They also said Iran was working to reopen its Sassan field,
  part of the same reservoir as Abu al-Bukhoosh and located only
  a few miles away. Sassan was heavily damaged by an Iraqi air
  raid only 10 days before Abu al-Bukhoosh was attacked.

  Iranian Prime Minister Mir-Hossein
  Mousavi said Iran had ""more effective"" missiles at its disposal
  than the shore-to-sea missiles which had provoked U.S. Concern,
  Tehran Radio reported.
      A U.S. State Department spokesman said last week Iran had
  acquired Chinese-made Silkworm missiles which posed a greater
  threat to shipping in the Gulf than the weapons previously
  used.
      Tehran Radio, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp,
  quoted Mousavi as saying that Tehran officially announced after
  its forces overran southern Iraq's Faw peninsula in February
  last year that it had shore-to-sea missiles.
      ""The fact that the Americans, after so much delay, are now
  thinking of expressing their concern with panic is because
  Reagan needs this sensation now,"" said Mousavi, speaking after a
  cabinet meeting in Tehran.
      ""We also announce today that these missiles are not the
  limit of our war capabilities in the Gulf,"" he added.
      Mousavi said the security of the Gulf region had nothing to
  do with the U.S. But Iran would resort to any action to defend
  the Gulf, ""even those actions which are not thought probable by
  Westerners.""

  Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said he
  held ""frank"" discussions with the Canadian province premiers on
  the pace of free trade talks with the United States, but the
  longstanding issue of provincial ratification remains to be
  settled.
      Speaking to reporters after nearly five hours of meetings
  with the 10 premiers, Mulroney said further discussions would
  be held in June and September to discuss the role of the
  provinces in approving any new trade deal.
      But he maintained progress was being made in the sweeping
  talks with the Unites States that got under nearly two years
  ago.
      ""It appears reasonable progress is being made (in the
  talks),"" Mulroney said.
      Alberta Premier Don Getty agreed, ""Things are running pretty
  quickly now.""
      The talks, launched by Mulroney's Progressive Conservative
  government after concerns about protectionist sentiment in the
  U.S., are aimed reducing the remaining barriers between the
  world's largest trading partnership.
      But the provinces are expected to play a major role in any
  new trading arrangement, and some of the provincial leaders
  complained of a lack of progress on reaching a ratification
  formula.
      ""It's my view that we should be thinking about these things
  right now, along with the questions of the substance of the
  agreement,"" commented Ontario Premier David Peterson, who has
  been highly critical of the talks in the past.
      But Newfoundland Premier Brian Peckford said an agreement
  was more likely to emerge by consensus and there would be no
  need for a ""hard and fast formula.""
      Peckford said it appears Canada is prepared to make
  concessions to the United States on financial services in order
  to make inroads on other bargaining areas, such as agriculture.
      Canadian published reports, quoting government sources, say
  the two countries are close to reaching a trade deal and it
  will involve eliminating border tariffs and many non-tariff
  barriers over the next 10 to 12 years.
      A rough draft of the accord is expected to be presented to
  the premiers at the June meeting while the finished document is
  hoped to be presented to Congress in October.
      ""It's a very tight time frame,"" Ontario's Peterson said last
  night. ""But at this moment it is tough to say what will
  transpire.""

  Laidlaw Transportation Ltd said
  earnings per share for the current fiscal year should increase
  by ""substantially more"" than the 30 pct average annual growth
  experienced in the last four years.
      Revenues for the year ended August 31 will be about 1.2
  billion dlrs, including GSX Corp, the U.S. waste services unit
  acquired from Imasco Ltd last year for 358 mln dlrs, Laidlaw
  president Michael de Groote told analysts.
      Last year, Laidlaw had operating earnings of 66.2 mln dlrs,
  or 63 cts per share, on revenues of 717.8 mln dlrs.
      De Groote also said the company expects ""excellent results""
  in the second quarter ended February 28, but would not be more
  specific.
      He said his revenue estimate for fiscal 1987 does not
  include possible further acquisitions and said that the
  addition of GSX will produce increasing benefits in fiscal 1988
  through fiscal 1990.
      De Groote said the increased earnings in the previous four
  quarters was due partly to internal growth of about 15 pct. The
  rest came from acquisitions, he said.
      Laidlaw expects to sell a small rubber recycling operation,
  a subsidiary of GSX, within the next few weeks, but this will
  not make any material contribution to earnings, de Groote said.
      He also said he is ""not very optimistic"" about the ongoing
  negotiations to buy 50 pct of Tricil Ltd, a Toronto-based
  chemical and solid waste services company with Canadian and
  U.S. operations, from &lt;Trimac Ltd> of Calgary.
      De Groote said that, regardless of the outcome of the
  proposed Tricil acquisition, Laidlaw will decide within the
  next 30 days whether to stay in the North American chemical
  waste business through GSX Corp.
      ""We feel it is a profitable business with good growth
  potential and we now want to stay in it if we can get the right
  management,"" de Groote said.
      Laidlaw financed the acquisition of GSX by its U.S.
  subsidiary, Laidlaw Transportation Inc, with the proceeds of a
  200 mln Canadian dlr preferred stock issue and borrowing.
      De Groote said the company will gain about 138 mln dlrs in
  cash by August 31 from the exercise of warrants.
      De Groote also said waste services in fiscal 1987 will
  represent about 49 pct of revenues, school buses will
  contribute 49 pct and trucking about two pct.
      The trucking subsidiary in western Canada is performing
  well and there are no plans to sell it, he said.
      He would not estimate the contribution of each segment to
  earnings per share for the year. He also said that further
  acquisitions of school bus operations in the U.S. are likely
  within the next few months.

  Today's debt rescheduling talks
  between the Philippines government and its bank advisory
  committee were postponed until Thursday to give the banks more
  time to consider Manila's novel proposal for paying part of its
  interest bill in notes instead of cash, bankers said.
      The committee banks met briefly earlier today and decided
  that they needed more time in particular to consider a news
  report which quoted a Reagan Administration official as urging
  that the proposal be given serious consideration.
      ""The banks felt that this was new information and that
  further consultation was called for,"" one banker said.    
      In a despatch yesterday from Washington, Reuters quoted the
  official as saying Manila's plan to pay some interest with
  notes that could be converted into equity investments in the
  Philippines was fully consistent with the Reagan Administration
  strategy for handling developing country debt.
      ""The Philippine proposal is very interesting, it's quite
  unique and I don't think it's something that should be
  categorically rejected out of hand,"" the official said.
      Because of the key role the U.S. plays in the debt crisis,
  foreign banks in particular wanted time to analyze the
  significance of the policymaker's comments, bankers said.

  Baker International Corp treasurer Eric
  Mattson said the company hoped to iron out snags in a proposed
  merger with Hughes Tool Co &lt;HT> but declined to say if or what
  compromises might be acceptable to it.
      The proposed merger that would create a 1.2 billion dlr
  oilfield services company was thrown into limbo yesterday when
  Hughes management, balking at the terms of a government consent
  decree, offered a counter-proposal to Baker.
      Earlier today, Hughes adjourned a shareholders meeting
  called to vote on the proposed merger until March 11 and said
  it hoped to resume negotitations with Baker.
      Hughes chairman W.A. Kistler told reporters that Hughes did
  not want to sign the Department of Justice consent decree until
  after Baker's submersible pump and drilling bit operations were
  sold.
      Mattson told Reuters that Baker still believed a merger was
  possible between the two giant oilfield service companies.
      ""The company's position is we would like to see the merger
  be completed, which is in the best interests of our
  shareholders and their shareholders,"" Mattson said.
      ""Our goal is for a merger to occur. Because of the
  litigation, I can't go any further than that,"" he said.
      Baker filed a lawsuit in Texas state court late yesterday
  to force Hughes to abide by terms of the proposed consent
  decree.
      Mattson also declined to comment on whether the directors
  of Baker and Hughes have scheduled any meetings to discuss the
  merger.

  A White House-ordered report said 
  that growing U.S. reliance on foreign oil into the year 2000
  could have potentially damaging implications for national
  security.
      The Energy Department study discusses several options to
  curb reliance on foreign oil, but makes no recommendations.
      President Reagan and most Congressmen have previously ruled
  out a tax on foreign oil as a way to curb imports and to help
  the depressed domestic oil industry.
      Energy Secretary John Herrington said in a statement that
  ""although we have made gains in energy security in the last six
  years, this report shows that there is justification for
  national concern both over declining competitiveness of our
  domestic oil and gas industry and over rising oil imports.""
      The report said imports last year were 33 pct of U.S.
  consumption and by the mid-1990s could rise to 50 pct.
      Among the report's options to ease U.S. reliance on foreign
  oil are several already advocated by the Reagan Administration.
      President Reagan ordered the study last September, citing a
  determination that the country never again become captive to a
  foreign oil cartel, referring to the OPEC-led oil shortages and
  sharp prices increases of the 1970s.
      The report said an import fee would raise prices and help
  make it economical for U.S. oil firms to find and produce new
  oil, as well as to cut imports, but on the whole the tax would
  depress the nation's economy.

training/8098,"U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - MINI-REFUNDING
  A hefty slice of new U.S. Treasury
  supply is not the most welcome prospect for a slumbering credit
  market, but at least this week's offerings should provide it
  with some focus, economists said.
      ""Banks and mutual funds have cash that should be put to
  work, so the auctions should breathe some life into the market,""
  said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.
      The Treasury will place a 25 billion dlr package of
  two-year, four-year and seven-year notes on the sales block
  this week.
      The ""mini-refunding,"" which will raise 9.27 billion dlrs in
  new cash, comprises 10 billion dlrs of two-year notes for
  auction on Tuesday, 7.75 billion dlrs of four-year notes on
  Wednesday and 7.25 billion dlrs of seven-year notes on
  Thursday. The market also faces the regular weekly three- and
  six-month bill auction today, amounting to 12.8 billion dlrs.
      The mini-refunding does not come at a particularly
  auspicious time for the market. Bond prices have been drifting
  sideways in a narrow range against the backdrop of a cloudy
  U.S. Economic outlook, diminished chances of a change in
  Federal Reserve Board policy and a stable dollar.
      Moreover, the bond market's inertia has compared
  unfavourably with the rash of activity taking place in
  high-yield markets overseas, like the U.K., As well as in U.S.
  Equities.
      But according to the Merrill Lynch economists, there are
  signs the pall hanging over the U.S. Bond market is lifting a
  bit.
      ""Customer activity has been light, but all on the buy-side,
  and there is a marked absence of selling,"" they said in a weekly
  report.
      Philip Braverman of Irving Trust Securities Inc believes
  banks will snap up the two- and four-year issues at this week's
  sales.
      ""The banks are in need of investments that provide earnings.
  Though the yield spread to the cost of carrying these
  maturities has been wider, it is still positive,"" he said in a
  weekly market review.
      But economists agreed not even the auctions will generate
  enough impetus for a major move. This will only come once the
  overseas markets have had their run.
      ""Based on last week's events, there is little to indicate
  that the appetite for yield has begun to wane,"" said economists
  at Salomon Brothers Inc.
      Indeed, talk persisted last week that Japanese investors
  are planning to re-weight their portfolios in favour of the
  higher-yielding markets at the start of Japan's new fiscal year
  on April 1.
      And while traditionally the Japanese have not been big
  buyers of the shorter-dated issues on offer at this week's U.S.
  Auctions, such reports undermine market confidence.
      Even actions by the British, Australian and Canadian
  monetary authorities to curb the rise of their currencies
  should also enhance the attractiveness of their respective bond
  markets, the Salomon Brothers' economists said.
      Meanwhile, ecomomic releases are unlikely to enliven the
  U.S. Market unless they deviate widely from expectations,
  economists said.
      This week's economic calendar begins on Tuesday with
  February durable goods orders. Economists expect a rebound from
  January's depressed levels.
      Peter Greenbaum of Smith, Barney, Harris Upham and Co said
  several areas, including transport equipment, should have
  bounced back. But a decline in military capital goods will cap
  total new orders. He forecasts a rise of two pct after
  January's 6.7 pct slump. Some other economists foresee a gain
  as large as five pct.
      Friday's consumer price report for February is expected to
  show an increase of about 0.3 pct after a 0.7 pct January gain.
  Economists said energy prices -- the driving force behind the
  January rise -- rose more moderately last month, while food
  prices declined.
      Meanwhile, economists warned that the federal funds rate
  will be subject to volatility in the weeks ahead due to the
  approach of quarter-end and the mid-April tax date.
      Some economists expect the Fed to execute a bill pass this
  week because its adding requirement increases sharply in the
  new statement period beginning on Thursday.
      Fed funds traded at 6-1/16 pct late Friday and are expected
  to open near that level.

  The new interest rate of 7/8 pct over

  effect today, Finance Minister Manuel Azpurua said .
      Azpurua told reporters yesterday the reduction from the
  previous margin of 1-1/8 pct above Libor will save the country
  some 50 mln dollars in debt servicing.
      The new rate is among changes agreed last month to the 20.3
  billion dlr public sector debt rescheduling. Under the new
  agreement, Venezula was also able to extend the term from 12 to
  14 years and to lower debt payments in the 1987-89 period by 64
  pct.
      Azpurua said that according to the agreement, the new
  interest rate will be retroactive to April 1, provided the
  accord is approved before October 1.
      He told reporters the term sheet detailing the changes in
  the rescheduling has already been endorsed by the 13-member
  debt steering committee and is now being sent to the country's
  460 creditor banks for their approval.
      The new agreement replaces a rescheduling accord signed in
  February 1986, which Venezuela asked to revise to reflect a 45
  pct drop in oil revenues.

  The European Community (EC) considers
  talks on agricultural trade reform to be inseperable from talks
  on other trade reform in the present GATT round, Willy de
  Clercq, external relations commissioner of the EC, said.
      He told reporters here the EC would not bow to pressure to
  reach an early, seperate agreement on agricultural trade.
      He said the EC wanted to stick to the four-year schedule
  agreed by members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
  (GATT) in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last year. That included
  agricultural trade liberalisation for the first time in the
  lengthy program to re-negotiate the GATT.
      Other trade issues being discussed in the current GATT
  round include reform of trade in merchandise and services.
      De Clercq is on his way to China after attending a two-day
  conference for 22 GATT trade ministers held in New Zealand.
      Several of those ministers criticised the EC for what they
  saw as restrictive agricultural trade practices and called for
  urgent reforms. U.S. Trade representative, Clayton Yeutter,
  also said it was important agreement on agricultural trade
  reform was reached as early as possible.
      But de Clercq said the GATT program had been reached after
  long and hard negotiations, and the EC did not want changes.
      ""We just want to stick to the agreement which was reached,
  and that was very clear -- that the new round would be one
  undertaking. It is a global negotiation with no two tracks, no
  fast track, no slow track. It has just one track, the track -
  and that's all,"" de Clercq said.
      ""If you start selecting priorities, your priority is not my
  priority. We say that agriculture is urgent, but it's not the
  only urgent thing,"" he said.
      He said the Punte del Este agreement had taken eight months
  to prepare and eight days of negotiations.

training/7135,"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - U.S. DEFICIT WITH NICs
  The U.S. trade deficit with Taiwan and
  Korea is expected to widen this year, despite some economic and
  currency adjustments by the two newly industrialized countries,
  economists said.
      ""The surpluses that Taiwan and Korea ran with the U.S. in
  1986 will get bigger. This time next year, the U.S. will be
  screaming at those countries about their exports,"" said Steve
  Cerier of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
      Taiwan is currently the third biggest exporter to the U.S.
  after Japan and Canada, while Korea is the seventh largest.
      Faced with heightened protectionist sentiment in Congress,
  the Reagan administration has been stepping up the rhetoric
  against Taiwan and Korea, urging those countries to allow their
  currencies to appreciate and lift impediments to free trade.
      The thrust has shifted to those newly industrialized
  countries (NICs) amid signs the dollar's steep drop against the
  currencies of Japan and most EC nations -- previously the main
  focus of the U.S. drive to cut its trade gap -- is beginning to
  close the competiveness gap for American goods.
      U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker said recently that he
  expects a reduction in Japan's trade surplus this year.
      But U.S. manufacturers still are losing markets on their
  own doorstep to Taiwan and Korea, whose currencies have not
  risen as much as the yen and the mark. As major beneficiaries
  of soft oil prices and with low labor costs, Taiwanese and
  Korean exporters are well-placed to take up the slack.
      ""In 1986, the fashionable comment in Washington was
  Japan-bashing. Now it's NIC-bashing,"" said Robert Chandross, of
  Lloyds Bank PLC.
      Asia's four main NICs -- Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore
  and Taiwan -- accounted for almost one-fifth of the overall 170
  billion dlr U.S. merchandise trade deficit for 1986.
      The U.S. trade gap with Taiwan rose to 15.7 billion dlrs in
  1986 from 13.1 billion in 1985, while the bilateral trade
  deficit with South Korea grew to 7.1 billion from 4.8 billion.
      And preliminary U.S. data show that the growth trend is
  continuing. The U.S. trade shortfall with Taiwan was 1.6
  billion dlrs in January, up 24.4 pct from a year earlier. The
  gap with Korea was 700 mln dlrs, up 24.8 pct from a year ago.
      Lately both nations have said they will take steps to
  defuse incipient trade tensions. Korea said it is choosing many
  of the 122 items on which the U.S. wants it to cut import
  tariffs in order to deflect pressure for currency revaluation.
      Still, South Korean trade minister Rha Woong Bae said last
  week that Korea would maintain a trade surplus for three to
  five years as a way to cut its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt.
      For its part, Taiwan said in January that it will cut
  tariffs on 1,700 goods sometime in the second half of 1987 and
  try to diversify exports. But vice economic minister Wang
  Chien-Shien said last month that he still does not expect
  Taiwan's trade surplus with the U.S. will fall in 1987.
      The NICs have made deep inroads into markets for textiles
  and electronic goods. But Korea is raising its profile in the
  area of ""big-ticket"" manufactured goods, notably cars.
      Korea expects its auto exports -- mostly for North America
  -- to balloon to 675,000 units in 1987 from zero in 1985.
      ""The NICs' exports are almost all manufactured goods. When
  their exports rise it hits the heart of the U.S. manufacturing
  base. It cuts directly to us and to our customers,"" said Bob
  Wendt, manager for economic studies at Bethlehem Steel Corp.
      The U.S. takes 90 pct of Korea's computer products exports,
  72 pct of its electrical appliances and 65 pct of its
  telecommunications equipment.
      A recent study by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co says Taiwan and
  South Korea are the most pressing trade issue for the U.S.
      While Hong Kong and Singapore run trade surpluses with the
  U.S., these are offset by their deficits with other countries.
      But Taiwan and, to a lesser extent, South Korea, stand in
  marked contrast. Both of these nations have moved rapidly into
  large bilateral surplus with the U.S. and major overrall trade
  and current account surpluses, the Morgan study says.
      Morgan expects Taiwan's overall trade surplus to grow to
  18.5 billion dlrs in 1987 from 15.2 billion last year, and
  Korea's to increase to 6.5 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion.
      Concern about the NICs is not confined to the U.S.
      ""A lot of Korea and Taiwan's exports to the U.S. have been
  at Japan's expense,"" said Richard Koss at General Motors Corp.
      February's Paris meeting of six major industrial powers
  exorted NICs to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies.
      But this two-pronged approach has drawn little response
  from the two nations so far and, in any case, will only work
  with a sizeable lag, economists say.
      The U.S. has not said how much it thinks the Taiwan's and
  Korea's currencies should climb. The Taiwan dollar, which is
  pegged to the U.S. dollar, has risen about 15 pct since
  September 1985 while the Korean won has risen about five pct.
      But in real terms the Taiwan dollar has been flat against
  the U.S. unit and the won has lost seven pct, economists say.
      ""We've not seen any lessening of competition from those
  countries that we can attribute to currency changes,"" said
  Bethlehem Steel's Wendt.
      And so far, U.S. pleas for Taiwan and Korea to use their
  hefty export earnings to import more have had little effect.
      Moreover, it is uncertain how far U.S. protectionism will
  get given the administration's free-trade stance. ""It's hard to
  see that anything will be passed much before year-end. And then
  the question is, will it have teeth?"" one economist said.

training/13123,"LOWER U.S. RICE STOCKS, STRONG EXPORTS - USDA
  Rising demand for U.S. rice may
  gradually reduce surpluses while a marketing loan should help
  increase the U.S. share of the world rice market despite
  sluggish trade this year, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
      In its quarterly rice outlook and situation summary, the
  department said U.S. rice use may surpass production during the
  1986/87 marketing year, causing stocks to fall about 10 mln
  hundredweight from a year earlier to an estimated 67 mln cwt on
  July 31.
      Long grain acreage as a percentage of total acreage is
  expected to decline this year, the report said.
      USDA said factors once supportive of increased long grain
  acreage have turned around. Domestic prices of medium grain
  relative to long grain have increased, the loan differential
  has been greatly reduced and increases in long grain yields
  relative to those of other classes have leveled off.
      With the drop in domestic prices resulting from the
  marketing loan, domestic rice use is expected to grow at a
  faster rate, USDA said.
      ""Development of new products and increased promotion have
  helped make rice more available and visible to a wider range of
  consumers,"" USDA said.
      USDA said world trade is expected to fall in 1987 because
  of large production and stocks but a weaker market should
  affect competing exporters more than the U.S.
      ""The United States has already recovered a substantial share
  of the European Community market and made inroads into markets
  in the Middle East and Africa,"" the report said.
      World rice consumption is projected to reach record levels
  in 1986/87, the report said, as higher per capita incomes,
  increased domestic production and low import prices have
  allowed people in many countries to substitute rice for coarse
  grains.
      China, India and South Korea have increased output, while
  the Middle East and Africa have doubled imports since the
  mid-1970s, the report said.

  variable import tariff is most persuasive,"" Krapels, president

  Energy and Power subcommittee hearing.
      ""An optimal tariff would be one implemented only if the

  controls on natural gas, repeal the windfall profits tax on oil
  companies, allow exports of Alaskan oil and provide tax
  incentives for U.S. oil production, or, at the least, preserve

  Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou
  said today that the Greek armed froces were ready to tackle any
  aggressors following the sailing of a Turkish research vessel
  and warships towards disputed waters in the Aegean Sea.
      Papandreou told an emergency cabinet meeting in Athens ""the
  military readiness of our country is able now to give a very
  hard lesson if our neighbours (Turkey) were to carry out
  military actions.""
      He said the activities of the research vessel could be
  aimed at partitioning the Aegean.
      ""The air force, navy and army are in a state of alert,""
  General Guven Ergenc, Secretary General of the Turkish General
  Staff, told a news conference.
      He said the Turkish research ship Sismik 1, escorted by an
  unspecified number of warships, would sail into disputed waters
  in the Aegean Sea tomorrow morning.
      Ergenc told Reuters later that all leave had been cancelled
  for members of the armed forces in the Aegean coast area.
      The Turkish government said yesterday it had licensed the
  state-owned Turkish Petroleum Corp to explore for oil in
  international waters around three Greek islands off Turkey.
       Greece and Turkey have long-standing disputes over areas
  of the Aegean and the presence of Turkish troops in Cyprus.
      The latest row erupted when the Greek government said last
  month that it was taking control of a Canadian-led consortium
  which was already producing oil off the Greek island of Thassos
  and would drill in the same area after the takeover.
      Ergenc told the news conference the alert followed a
  government decision that Turkey should protect its interests
  ""because of measures Greece has been taking in the Aegean in
  violation of international agreements.""
      Asked how Turkey would react if Greece attacked any of the
  vessels, he said ""If there is an attack, it is clear what has to
  be done. An attack on a warship is a cause for war."" But he
  added ""We are not in a state of war. The measures taken by the
  military are directed towards protecting our rights.""
      Greece said yesterday it would defend its national rights
  in the Aegean and urged Turkey to accept reference of the
  dispute to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
      Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Yalim Eralp told
  reporters today this was unacceptable because of preconditions
  Athens had attached.
      In Athens, Greek Prime Minister Papandreou said that if the
  Turkish vessel Sismik 1 began research operations ""we will
  hinder it, of course not with words, as it cannot be stopped
  with words.""
      Greek newspapers said the armed forces were on alert and
  navy ships had gone to the Aegean. But government spokesman
  Yannis Roubatis did not confirm the move, saying only ""The Greek
  fleet is not at its naval base.""
      Papandreou said that a map issued in Turkey showed 95 pct
  of the areas proposed for research were on the Greek
  continental shelf.
      Papandreou told the U.S. And NATO that if they had a part
  in orchestrating the present crisis in order to force Greece to
  negotiate with Turkey, the Greek government would not accept
  it.
      Papandreou has maintained in the past that he will not
  negotiate with Ankara until Turkey recognises Greek rights in
  the Aegean and withdraws its troops from Cyprus.
      He said that in the case of war with Turkey it would not be
  possible for Greece to discuss the future of American military
  bases here. Asked by reporters if he would close the U.S. Bases
  in Greece in the event of war, Papandreou replied ""Obviously,
  and perhaps even before the war.""

  The use of generic commodity
  certificates, or ""certs,"" for fiscal years 1986-88 will save
  the government 50 to 100 mln dlrs, Department of Agriculture
  Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said.
      Speaking at a House agriculture subcommittee hearing on the
  use of the certificates, Amstutz said that the issuance of 8.5
  billion dlrs of certificates during fiscal years 1986-88 could
  result in government outlays of up to 400 mln dlrs.
      However, the use of certificates preclude the need for 450
  to 500 mln dlrs in storage and handling costs, resulting in net
  savings for the government of 50-100 mln dlrs, he said.
      Without the use of certificates, Amstutz said nearly the
  entire 1985 crop which had been put under loan would have been
  forfeited to the Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC.
      In addition, 260 mln bushels of grain that have been
  redeemed from CCC inventory through certificate exchanges would
  have remained in the goverment inventory, he said.
      When asked to comment on a recent study by the General
  Accounting Office that concluded certificates result in a net
  cost to the government, Amstutz said, ""GAO underestimated the
  benefits and overstated the costs"" of the certificate program.
      Amstutz said while certificates encourage more loan
  entries, they also encourage heavier loan redemptions rather
  than forfeitures.
      GAO underestimated this net loan activity, Amstutz said.
      ""There is no question in the mind of the Department of
  Agriculture that these certificates have been very useful,""
  Amstutz said.
      Immediate benefits of certificates include greater market
  liquidity, improved market price competitiveness, higher farm
  income, and improved debt situation and decreased carrying
  costs, he said.
      Certificates are an integral part of USDA's long-range
  market-oriented farm policy, he said.
      Amstutz told subcommittee Chairman Rep. Dan Glickman,
  D-Kans., that USDA is in the process of preparing an official
  response to the GAO study on certificates and will submit it to
  the subcommittee when completed.

  European Community (EC)
  finance ministers and central bankers agreed on the need for
  greater cooperation to strengthen the European Monetary System
  (EMS) against international market turbulence, officials said.
      ""There was a general will to reinforce the European Monetary
  System, with all that implies,"" Belgian Finance Minister Mark
  Eyskens said yesterday after hosting a one-day session of
  informal talks at this Belgian coastal resort.
      The gathering was the first such discussion since the
  second major realignment of EMS parities within nine months in
  January.
      The system has come under severe strain as funds have
  flowed out of the slumping dollar and into the dominant EMS
  currency, the West German mark, sending it soaring against
  weaker currencies in the system.
      But Eyskens said February's agreement between leading
  western industrialised nations to stabilise exchange rates at
  around current levels was working and this would allow the EC
  to speed up its efforts to boost the internal stability of the
  EMS.
      He told a news conference yesterday's meeting agreed on the
  need for closer coordination among EMS member governments of
  interest rate policies and of interest rate differentials
  between different countries.
      They also agreed they needed better coordination of
  exchange market intervention to hold currencies stable, both
  when they reached their fixed EMS limits and within their
  agreed margins.
      But Eyskens said this coordination raised a whole range of
  technical problems and ministers would discuss these further in
  Luxembourg in June on the basis of proposals from the EC's
  Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors.
      He said the EC needed a set of indicators of economic
  convergence betwen Community countries and it was important
  that interest rates fulfilled this role together with exchange
  rates and inflation rates.
      The Belgian minister, whose country presently holds the
  presidency of the community, made clear the meeting had not
  produced any agreement to move radically forward in developing
  the EMS towards the EC's long term goal of economic and
  monetary integration.
      ""We have committed ourselves to reestablishing the normal
  functioning of the system,"" Eyskens said.
      Eyskens has repeatedly stressed that he believes the EMS
  has to be reinforced if the EC's plans to liberalise all
  movements of capital across national borders by 1992 are to go
  ahead.
      EC executive Commission President Jacques Delors told the
  meeting the authority would put forward proposals for a final
  phase of capital market liberalisation in October that would
  include safeguard clauses for member countries for which the
  move would create difficulties.
      Eyskens said the ministers and central bankers also
  discussed the need to ""dedramatise"" realignments of EMS parities
  by letting high-ranking monetary officials carry them out by
  telephone rather than calling a meeting of finance ministers.
      However, West German sources said Bonn Finance Minister
  Gerhard Stoltenberg was unenthusiastic about the idea.
      British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told
  journalists that one of the technical issues raised by greater
  coordination of exchange market intervention was the question
  of which currencies should be used to intervene and held in
  central bank reserves.
      He said several EMS member countries believed the EMS would
  work better if central banks held each other's currencies -- an
  issue of particular importance regarding West Germany since the
  Bundesbank holds only dollars in its foreign exchange reserves.
      He said the debate on dedramatising EMS realignments
  reflected a general feeling among participants that the way the
  January reshuffle had been conducted was unsatisfactory.
     The realignment was marked by acrimony between France and
  West Germany, with each side blaming the other for strains in
  the system that forced the parity overhaul.

  The agreement between the U.S. And the

  provides an equal chance for all non-EC countries to supply the
  Spanish market, an EC Commission spokeswoman said.
      She denied that any unpublished clause of the agreement
  guaranteed the bulk of the maize export business would go to
  the U.S., As one EC official told Reuters yesterday.
      Under the agreement, the EC will import two mln tonnes of
  maize and 300,000 tonnes of sorghum a year into Spain at
  specially reduced levy rates for the next four years.
      The Commission has yet to decide whether the maize will

  Grain analysts said the increase of

  affect the market Tuesday.
      They said the market already has discounted higher Soviet
  imports, partly on news last month that the Soviet Union bought
  one mln tonnes of U.S. corn, and on rumors that the Reagan
  administration is pushing for authority to sell the Soviets
  U.S. wheat under the Export Enhancement Program.
      In its supply-demand report, the USDA raised its estimate
  for 1986/87 Soviet grain imports to 26 mln tonnes from 23 mln.
      ""That was business already done, for all practical

  E.F. Hutton Group's E.F. Hutton LBO Inc

  April six from midnight April one.
      E.F. Hutton lbo inc said its wholly owned PC Acquisition

  both expiration date and the withdrawal rights period for its
  pending tender for 6.3 mln shares or 83 pct of Purolator

      Both offers would pay shareholders a package of securities
  for the balance of their shares, valued at the respective

      Hutton said as of the end of the day yesterday, about
  880,000 shares of Purolator common stock repesenting 11.5 pct
  of outstanding shares had been validly tendered and not
  withdrawn.
      Manhattan supreme court justice Lewis Grossman today
  adjourned until Monday a hearing on a stockholder suit seeking
  to block the Hutton LBO transaction. The judge told attorneys
  he needed time to hear other cases.
      Plaintiffs cited their belief that a superior offer would

      Yesterday, Frank Hoenemeyer, a retired vice chairman of

      Hoenemeyer testified that by the next meeting of the board,

  The Great Northern Nekoosa Corp
  said it will recommend to shareholders a two-for-one common
  stock split.
      The company said it will make the proposal to shareowners
  at its annual mmeting May 6 in Dothan, Ala., near the company's
  Great Southern Paper division operations.
      In conjunction with the stock split proposal, the
  shareowners will be asked to approve an increase in the
  authorized common stock from 60 mln to 150 mln shares, the
  company said.
      The company said it will propose an increase in its
  dividend rate if the split is approved effective with the June
  payment.
      The company said the present rate on GNN common is 43 cts
  per share. The company said it would recommend a quarterly rate
  of 23 cts a share on the split stock. This would be equal to a
  dividend of 46 cts a share on the present common, seven pct
  higher than the current rate.
      The company said it had increased the dividend by 13 pct
  last December. Great Northern Nekoosa's last common stock
  split, a three-for-two, was in December 1983, it said.
      As of Dec 31, 1986, there were 26,661,770 shares of GNN
  common stock outstanding, according to the company.

training/8623,"AUSTRALIAN OIL INDUSTRY TO CONTINUE TAX CAMPAIGN
  The council of the
  Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) said it
  will press on with its campaign for major improvements to
  Australia's petroleum taxation structure.
      The council said in a statement the industry was bitterly
  disappointed by the Australian government's position on
  taxation, as presented in a speech by Resources and Energy
  Minister Gareth Evans to the APEA conference.
      As earlier reported, Evans said he was inclined to target
  any tax changes rather than take a broad-based approach to
  secondary taxation of petroleum.
      APEA had expected the government to make positive responses
  to detailed industry submissions seeking the removal of
  existing secondary tax disincentives to exploration and
  development, the council said.
      It said it plans to reply in detail to issues raised by
  Evans, but its immediate concern was the decision to proceed
  with the current resource rental tax (RRT) legislation.
      Evans told the conference the government did not plan to
  accept industry pleas for changes in the legislation to allow
  deductibility of unsuccessful exploration expenditure.
      ""The government's unwillingness to allow the deduction of
  unsuccessful exploration expenditure within the whole offshore
  area in which RRT applies negates any claim that the tax is
  profit based,"" the APEA council said.
      The government missed a major opportunity to persuade oil
  exploration companies that it had realistic answers to the
  industry's concerns, despite its recognition of the industry's
  problems, the council said.
      The industry has called for the end of all discriminatory
  secondary taxation of petroleum, citing them as major
  disincentives at a time of low oil prices.

  Williams Cos said a fourth quarter charge
  of 250 mln dlrs from discontinued operations and writedowns
  contributed to a 1986 net loss of 240 mln dlrs or 6.97 dlrs a
  share against earnings of 31.6 mln dlrs or 92 cts in 1985.
      The loss in the quarter was 232.3 mln dlrs or 6.75 dlrs
  against income of 10.7 mln dlrs or 31 cts a year ago. Revenues
  in the quarter fell to 521.1 mln dlrs from 716.9 mln and in the
  year fell to 1.9 billion dlrs from 2.5 billion in 1985.
      Williams also said the previously announced sale of its
  Agrico Chemical Co unit to Freeport-Mcmoran Resource Partners
  Ltd has cleared antitrust review and should close next week.
      The 1987 first quarter will include proceeds from the
  Agrico sale, for 250 mln dlrs cash at closing plus deferred
  payments, and proceeds of 320 mln dlrs from the sale of a stake
  in Peabody Holding Co, completed in January.
      In the 1986 first quarter, Williams reported net of 14.2
  mln dlrs or 41 cts a share on sales of 796.4 mln dlrs.
      Williams said the charges in the current year were related
  to an ongoing restructuring. The company said the restructuring
  moves had improved its balance sheet and improved the outlook
  for future stability and growth in earnings.
      Operating profit at the company's Northwest Pipeline Corp
  unit fell 4.5 pct to 150 mln dlrs from lower sales. The
  Williams Natural Gas unit had operating profit of 50.5 mln dlrs
  compared to 90.9 mln dlrs on lower sales volumes.
      Profit at Williams Gas Marketing rose to 26 mln dlrs from
  about 22 mln and the William Pipe Line Co had operating profit
  of 49.4 mln dlrs versus 63.6 mln dlrs a year ago.

  The Bank of England said it had invited
  an early round of bill offers from the discount houses after
  forecasting a shortage in the system of around 1.1 billion stg.
      Money market dealers speculated that the central bank could
  be taking the opportunity to signal a reduction in U.K. Base
  lending rates by cutting the rates at which it intervenes in
  the discount market.
      Most operators are expecting a base rate cut today,
  possibly of one point, following yesterday's budget in which
  the U.K. Public sector borrowing target for 1987/88 was slashed
  by three billion stg.
      Among the main factors affecting liquidity, bills maturing
  in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain
  some 1.11 billion stg while a rise in note circulation and
  bankers' balances below target will take out around 120 mln stg
  and 20 mln stg respectively.
      Partly offsetting these outflows, exchequer transactions
  will add some 140 mln stg to the system today.

  Cyclops Corp said the three
  members of its board appointed last week by &lt;Dixons Group PLC>
  had resigned and that it named three Cyclops executives to
  replace them.
      Cyclops said the moves followed the announcement earlier
  today by Dixons that it received only 20 pct of Cyclops
  outstanding common stock under an extended tender offer that
  expired yesterday.
      Dixons initially ended its 90.25 dlr a share tender offer
  on March 17 after receiving 54 pct of Cyclops shares.
      However, the Securities and Exchange Commission last Friday
  pressed Dixons to reopen the offer because the U.K.-based
  company had dropped a condition that at least 80 pct of Cyclops
  stock be tendered by the close of the offer.
      Dixons then extended the offer until yesterday and earlier
  today indicated that a substantial number of tendered Cyclops
  shares had been withdrawn, leaving it with only 852,000 shares,
  or just over 20 pct of the roughly 4.26 mln Cyclops shares
  outstanding.
      Dixons said today that it purchased the tendered shares,
  which, when combined with the shares it already holds, gives it
  a 21.7 pct stake in Cyclops.
      Cyclops said its reconstituted board includes the three
  newly named directors and five outside directors, all of whom
  were on the board prior to Dixons tender offer.
      The three Cyclops directors were replaced by Dixons
  appointees on March 17 under an agreement reached between the
  two companies.

training/10078,"BP &lt;BP> DOES NOT PLAN TO HIKE STANDARD &lt;SRD> BID
  British Petroleum Co Plc does not
  intend to raise the price of its planned 70 dlr per share offer
  for the publicly held 45 pct of Standard Oil Co, BP Managing
  Director David Simon said.
      ""We don't seen this as any progressive bidding game,"" he
  told reporters at a news conference. BP now owns 55 pct of
  Standard's stock.
      Simon said BP had carefully considered the amount of its
  planned bid and he quoted an oil analyst, whom he would not
  identify, as saying BP's careful evaluation means the company
  is not going to raise its offer.
      ""I think that (an increase) would be totally wrong. I think
  the price is very fair and it is much to early to speculate
  about ligigation,"" he said. ""Let's wait and see how the offer
  runs.""
      Another official declined to speculate under what
  circumstances BP might raise its bid.
      The BP official said the 70 dlrs a share offer is 7.2 times
  Standard's 1986 cash flow and 56 pct above an independent
  evaluation of the company's assets, including the value of its
  oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves.
      He said the price Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD> &lt;SC> paid
  for publicly held Shell Oil Co shares in 1985 was 5.1 times
  cash flow.
      The BP official also said the 70 dlr bid is a 40 pct
  premium over Standard's stock price over the past year.
      BP Group Treasurer Rodney Chase said more than half to as
  much as two-third's of the 7.4 billion dlrs BP needs for its
  offer will come from existing sources. The rest will be
  financed by new debt.
      BP will draw in cash from its operating companies around
  the world and is also arranging a five billion dlr line of
  credit, he explained.
      The company's debt to equity ratio will rise 11 or 12
  percentage points from the current 33 pct if the offer is
  completed, Chase said. But the ratio will be back below 40 pct
  within 12 months, he added.
      Chase also said 50 to 60 pct of Standard Oil's publicly
  held shares are held by financial institutions.
      Simon said Standard's board was informed of the offer on
  March nine and has been considering it since that time.
      He said BP does not expect any regulatory problems that
  would delay completion of the acquisition. ""We have informed
  Washington of our intentions and we've already been an integral
  part of ownership of U.S. oil reserves,"" he pointed out.
      Simon said there is a good chance that current world oil
  prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel could be maintained, and that
  the more stable market is due mostly to changes in policy in
  Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members to control oil production.
      ""We think there are signals that current conditions are
  more favorable than they have been for sometime,"" Simon said.
      ""We have hopes for greater stability, but we do not see
  prices going much higher,"" he added.

training/6156,"ANALYSTS SAY U.K. BUDGET POINTS TO BASE RATE CUTS
  Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
  Lawson's Budget speech was described as sound and well balanced
  by analysts, if slightly lacking in excitement.
      A cut in bank base lending rates is now widely expected
  tomorrow, with most forecasts predicting a half-point fall. A
  follow-up half-point cut is anticipated next week.
      ""Worthy but boring would probably sum it up,"" Peter Fellner,
  U.K. Economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co, said. ""It was
  a very, very prudent fiscal budget.""
      Richard Jeffrey of brokers Hoare Govett said it was a
  well-balanced budget within the confines of the government's
  philosophy of keeping expenditure levels flat.
      Most analysts said the Budget was very sound on the fiscal
  side, but offered nothing new on monetary policy.
      As was widely expected, Lawson split his ""fiscal adjustment""
  between trimming the 1987/88 PSBR target to 4.0 billion stg
  from 7.1 billion and cutting basic rate income tax from 29 to
  27 pct.
      The target for the narrow measure of money supply, M0, was
  kept unchangd at two to six pct, while the target for the broad
  Sterling M3 aggregate was dropped.
      Both Jeffrey and Fellner said the budget clears the way for
  a half-point fall in U.K. Base rates tomorrow, but the
  authorities are unlikely to sanction a larger cut immediately.
  Many analysts and currency dealers have forecast a full
  one-point cut tomorrow.
      ""The Bank of England will be loathe to take any action which
  it will have to reverse later,"" Jeffrey said, though he added a
  further half-point cut was quite possible in the near future.
      The main worry from today's speech is the outlook for
  inflation, given the signs of relaxed monetary policy contained
  in it, Scrimgeour Vickers economist Richard Holt said.
      Holt noted the ""rather loose"" inflation forecast of 4.0 pct
  at end-1987, and said the lower interest rates likely to result
  from the tough fiscal stance could cause longer term concern.
      ""A higher PSBR target could be preferable in the long term,""
  he said, although lower mortgage interest rates on the back of
  falling base rates would have an offsetting impact on
  inflation.
      The Budget will inspire a lot of short-term confidence but
  it was ""not a good budget for inflation,"" he said
      Jeffrey said he would have liked Lawson to say more about
  the dangers of excessive liquidity build-up but overall was not
  too concerned about a revival of inflation.
      Fellner noted that the exchange rate was to remain the
  ""leading edge"" of monetary policy, but said the authorities were
  likely to be extremely cautious on this front.
      He said they were unlikely to hesitate in holding interest
  rates steady or even raising them again if sterling showed any
  signs of excessive weakness.
      Most analysts agreed Lawson had bolstered the credibility
  of the Budget by adopting realistic forecasts.
      Raising the forecast for the current account deficit from
  1.5 to 2.5 billion stg for 1987 would not unsettle the markets,
  which are already discounting that amount, Jeffrey said.
  that the 4.0 billion stg PSBR target was given credibility by
  the favourable outturn for 1986/87, which is now also forecast
  to be 4.0 billion stg.
      But analysts said the Budget speech did not give any
  clear-cut indication about the timing of the general election,
  which has to be held before June, 1988.
      Some believe it signals a poll this June, noting that the
  benefits, such as income tax cuts and the decision not to raise
  duties on alcohol and tobacco, become available immediately.
      But others said it kept several options open and it was not
  possible to deduce too much from it.
      James Capel's Fellner noted that by being fiscally prudent,
  Lawson had kept open the possibility of an autumn election in
  that there would be no ""chickens coming home to roost.""
      Richard Jeffrey, who favours the likelihood of a June
  election, said it was important the Chancellor had not gone for
  a Budget aimed overtly at buying an election victory.
      Nevertheless, he said, it was likely to result in a boost
  to the Conservative Party's pre-election popularity.

training/3062,"SOUTHERN &lt;SO> TO TAKE CHARGE ON VOGTLE COST
  Southern Co said it will take an
  after-tax charge of 226 mln dlrs against earnings no later than
  January 1988 because the projected cost of the Vogtle nuclear
  power plant has risen abover the amount which retail customers
  in Georgia will be asked to pay.
      The company's largest subsidiary, Georgia Power Co, said
  the budget for the plant has increased by 6.3 pct, or 522 mln
  dlrs, to 8.87 billion. However, because of a pledge the made
  last year to Georgia's Public Service Commission, the increased
  cost will not be included in the utility's retail electric
  rates.
      Geogia Power also said its board has delayed the scheduled
  completion of Vogtle's Unit Two to June 1989 from September
  1988. Unit Two is about 60 pct complete, it added.
      The utility said fuel loading has been completed at Unit
  One and the unit is being put through a series of low-power
  tests before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is asked for a
  full-power license.
      The nuclear power plant, located near Waynesboro, Ga., is
  co-owned by &lt;Oglethorpe Power Corp>, the Municipal Electric
  Authority of Georgia and the city of Dalton.
      Georgia Power said the revised Vogtle budget estimate was
  due to several factors, including additional labor costs
  incurred to keep the plant's first unit on schedule for
  commercial operation by June. The new figure represents the
  first change in the plant's budget since August 1985, when it
  was estimated at 8.35 billion dlrs.
      In March 1986, the utility told Georgia regulators it would
  ""cap"" the price of Vogtle its customers would be asked to pay
  at 3.56 billion dlrs, the company's share of the then projected
  8.35 billion dlr total. Under the new budget, Georgia Power
  said, its share amounts to 3.87 billion dlrs.
      Noting that Georgia Power's share of the Vogtle increase is
  313 mln dlrs, Southern said this will result in a charge
  against earnings of 177 mln dlrs after taxes.
      In addition, the company said, Georgia Power's contracts
  with the joint owners require the utility to buy back
  significant amounts of Vogtle capacity during the plant's
  initial years of operation. Under terms of the cap on costs, it
  will not attempt to recover the portion of the budget increase
  that applies to the buybacks.
      This bings the total amount that must be charged against
  earnings to 2326 mln dlrs after taxes, Southern said.
      Southern said new rules of the Financial Accounting
  Standards Board, which are effective in January 1988, require
  any costs that are determined nonrecoverable to be charged
  against earnings once that determination is made.
      The company also said its board has approved a capital
  budget of 2.1 billion dlrs in 1987, including work on the
  Vogtle project.
      It said a 5.9 billion dlr capita budget for the three-year
  period 1987-1989 was also outlined at the board meeting, noting
  this is 700 mln dlrs below the comparable figure for the years
  1986-1988.

  Argentine grain producers again
  reduced their estimates for the total yield of the 1986/87
  soybean crop, which will begin to be harvested in mid-April,
  trade sources said.
      They said growers now forecast soybean production this
  season at between 7.5 and 7.8 mln tonnes, down from last week's
  estimate of 7.7 to eight mln tonnes and the 8.0 to 8.4 mln
  tonnes forecast in mid-February.
      The new forecast is still higher than last season's record
  total production.
      Private sources put 1985/86 production at a record 7.2 to
  7.3 mln tonnes -- 4.2 to 6.4 pct lower than the new forecast
  for the current crop. The official figure for 1985/86 is 7.1
  mln tonnes, 5.6 to 9.9 pct below this season's new estimates.
      Growers in the past week discovered more empty soybean pods
  in the main producing areas of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe
  provinces and northern Buenos Aires.
      The crop since January has been hit by high temperatures
  and inadequate rainfall. Growers fear they may find more empty
  pods and have to further reduce their forecasts of total yield.
      The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 to
  3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct higher than the 1985/86
  record of 3.34 mln hectares.
      The state of the crop continued to be good in general until
  last week but intense, heavy rains since could have caused
  damage in areas where rainfall was higher than 100 mm.
      Where the rains were less heavy they were considered
  beneficial although too late to improve yield estimates.
      The rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops in
  southern Buenos Aires province but are not expected to
  influence production forecasts.
      In other areas, especially western Buenos Aires, where
  rainfall was more than 200 mm, parts of the sunflower, maize
  and sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged.
      The coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week by
  rains which also reached over 100 mm in parts of Cordoba, La
  Pampa and Santa Fe and almost 90 mm in parts of Entre Rios.
      The area sown with maize this season was between 3.58 and
  3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mln
  hectares in 1985/86.
      The yield of 1986/87 maize continued to be forecast at
  between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes.
      This estimate is 19.8 to 20.2 pct lower than the 12.4 to
  12.6 mln tonnes at which private sources put 1985/86 production
  and 21.1 to 22.7 pct lower than the official 12.8 mln tonnes.
      The sunflowerseed harvest has covered 23 to 26 pct of the
  area sown and continues in parts of central Buenos Aires
  although at a standstill elsewhere due to rain and floods.
      A resumption of full harvesting and assessment of damage is
  impossible until rains stop and a spell of a week to 10 days of
  sunshine dries the fields.
      The area sown this season was 2.0 to 2.2 mln hectares, down
  29.9 to 36.3 pct on last year's record 3.14 mln hectares.
      Sunflowerseed 1986/87 production is still forecast at 2.3
  to 2.6 mln tonnes, 34.1 to 41.5 pct below the 1985/86 record of
  4.1 mln tonnes.
      The grain sorghum harvest was the least affected by the
  rains, advancing steadily in Santa Fe and Cordoba and starting
  in La Pampa to cover 14 to 16 pct of the total area sown.
      The area sown was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2
  pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares the previous season.
      Yield estimates remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes, 16.7 to
  22 pct down on 1985/86 production of 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.

  Kuwait has asked at least four
  countries, including the United States, Soviet Union, Britain
  and China, for temporary use of their flags or tankers to
  protect Kuwaiti oil shipments in the troubled Persian Gulf,
  Reagan Administration officials said.
      The officials confirmed a New York Times report that Kuwait
  wants to transfer some of its oil tankers to U.S. or Soviet
  registration in hopes Iran would be reluctant to launch new
  ""Silkworm"" missiles at superpower flags.
      The United States has vowed to keep the gulf open to
  international oil traffic and has warned Tehran against using
  the Chinese-made missiles recently installed in Iran near the
  mouth of the gulf.
      ""They (the Kuwaitis) have also asked Britain, China and
  possibly some other European countries to lease tankers to
  carry their oil,"" one of the administration officials, who asked
  not to be identified, told Reuters.
      The United States is considering the request to temporarily
  transfer Kuwaiti ships to American registration, but such a
  move could create insurance and other problems, the officials
  said.
      U.S. defense officials told Reuters yesterday that Kuwait
  had decided for at least the time being not to accept a U.S.
  offer to use American warships to escort its tankers in the
  gulf, where both Iran and Iraq have been attacking shipping.

training/8902,"STANDARD CHARTERED BOOSTED BAD-DEBT PROVISIONS
  Standard Chartered Plc &lt;STCH.L>, faced
  with a recession in the key Singapore and Malaysian markets and
  an ongoing depression in the shipping industry, boosted its
  bad-debt provisions in 1986, chairman Lord Barber said.
      Barber said in a statement on the bank's 1986 results that
  bad and doubtful debt provisions, both general and specific,
  stood at 545.6 mln stg against 416.6 mln at end-1985.
      Bank figures showed the increase was almost exclusively in
  the specific bad risk provision, which qualifies for U.K. Tax
  breaks. New specific provisions rose by 111.5 mln stg while
  71.2 mln stg were reallocated from the general risk provision.
      In all, a 184.2 mln stg charge was made against profits for
  1986, compared with a 100.7 mln stg charge in 1985. Total
  pre-tax profits fell to 254 mln after 268 mln in 1985.
      ""The continuing serious recessionary conditions in Singapore
  and Malaysia and the depressed condition of the shipping
  industry made it necessary to provide heavily against bad and
  doubtful debs arising from loans in the Asia Pacific region, on
  top of the normal level of provisioning,"" Barber said.
      He said, ""the decision was also taken to build up loan loss
  reeserves by making a sizeable increase in the charges for
  general provisions for commercial and cross border risks.""
      Barber said due to bad-debt provisioning, the Asia Pacific
  region made ""a negligible contribution to pre-tax profits.""
      He said the profits contribution from the U.K. Businesses
  was ""well maintained, although the reported result was affected
  by cross border debt provisioning,"" while Californian subsidiary
  Union Bank ""showed continued growth.""
      ""Tropical Africa, Middle East and South Asia all turned in
  excellent performances and the revival in Europe continued,"" he
  said.
      Barber said the group, which succesfully fought off a
  takeover bid by Lloyds Bank &lt;LLOY.L> last year, strengthened
  its capital resources during that year to just over three
  billion stg, while total assets increased to 32.2 billion.
      Capital adequacy ratios remained strong, with the primary
  capital ratio standing at 7.5 pct at end 1986, he said.

  Imperial Oil Ltd, 70 pct owned by Exxon
  Corp &lt;XON>, will focus on maintaining its financial strength
  and improving near-term earnings performance through operating
  expense reductions and selective capital spending, the company
  said in the annual report.
      Imperial Oil said it expects to spend about 750 mln dlrs on
  capital and exploration expenditures in 1987, compared to 648
  mln dlrs in 1986 and 1.16 billion dlrs in 1985.
      Imperial previously reported 1986 operating net profit fell
  to 440 mln dlrs or 2.69 dlrs share from 694 mln dlrs or 4.27
  dlrs share in the prior year.
      Imperial Oil said the attention to earnings results from
  the desire to pursue longer term growth opportunities should
  the investment climate improve and the belief that low or
  volatile crude oil prices could continue during the next
  several years.
      The company also said actions initiated during 1986 to
  restructure and improve efficiency should continue to show
  benefits in 1987.
      During 1986, the company cut operating, administrative and
  marketing expenses by 91 mln dlrs and reduced the number of
  workers by 16 pct to 12,500.
      Imperial chairman Arden Haynes said in the annual report
  that it is too early to determine whether the recent upward
  movement in international oil prices will be sustained.
      ""It is still a time for prudence and caution, and the
  company's actions will continue to be based on the fundamentals
  of market supply and demand,"" he said.
      Haynes said prospects for the company's petroleum products
  division are more promising than before, but are still
  uncertain. Imperial's 1986 petroleum earnings rose to 174 mln
  dlrs from 102 mln dlrs in 1985.
      Haynes said more satisfactory product margins on its
  petroleum products could result if demand recovers as it has in
  the United States.
      The company's chemicals business outlook is mixed, Haynes
  said. Prospects for growth in petrochemical sales is good as
  long as economic growth continues, but future large grain
  surpluses could dampen fertilizer demand and maintain pressure
  on prices.
      Imperial's chemical business earned 17 mln dlrs in 1986,
  compared to three mln dlrs in 1985.

  Peru will put into effect Monday a foreign
  exchange rationing system for imports designed to stop a slide
  in the country's international reserves, a government decree in
  the Official Gazette said.
      Under the system, importers will be required to present a
  bill from the foreign seller of goods and apply for a license
  for foreign exchange. The central bank will have 10 days to
  decide whether to issue the required foreign exchange.
      Net international reserves now total about 800 mln dlrs
  compared to 1.54 billion dlrs a year ago.
      The system will be effective until the end of 1988.
      A ceiling for foreign exchange availability will be set by
  a council with members from the central bank, the economy
  ministry and the planning and foreign trade institutes. The
  central bank will issue licenses to procure foreign exchange in
  accordance with guidelines set by the council.
      Peru's reserves fell sharply due to a drop in the trade
  surplus to about five mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.1 billion in
  1985, according to preliminary central bank estimates.
     Total exports dropped to 2.50 billion dlrs last year against
  2.97 billion in 1985.
     Imports last year rose sharply as gross domestic product
  grew by about 8.5 pct, the highest economic growth level
  registered in 12 years. Imports were about 2.49 billion dlrs in
  1986 against 1.87 billion in 1985, according to preliminary
  estimates.
      The cushion of reserves allowed Peru to take a hard-line
  debt stance last year and suspend most payments due on its 14.3

training/236,"KUWAIT SAYS NO PLANS FOR EMERGENCY OPEC TALKS
  Kuwait""s Oil Minister, in remarks
  published today, said there were no plans for an emergency OPEC
  meeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in world
  oil prices.
      Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local
  daily al-Qabas as saying: ""None of the OPEC members has asked
  for such a meeting.""
      He denied Kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948,000
  barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed production
  limits of the 13-nation organisation.
      Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate
  OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mln
  bpd agreed in Geneva last December.
      They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with
  the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above
  quota. Kuwait, they said, was pumping 1.2 mln bpd.
      ""This rumour is baseless. It is based on reports which said
  Kuwait has the ability to exceed its share. They suppose that
  because Kuwait has the ability, it will do so,"" the minister
  said.
      Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability to
  produce up to 4.0 mln bpd.
      ""If we can sell more than our quota at official prices,
  while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their
  share, it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever,"" he said.
      He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar,
  which industry sources said was selling less than 180,000 bpd
  of its 285,000 bpd quota, because buyers were resisting
  official prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a marker
  of 18 dlrs per barrel.
      Prices in New York last week dropped to their lowest levels
  this year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of
  19 dollars a barrel.
      Sheikh Ali also delivered ""a challenge to any international
  oil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices.""
      Because it was charging its official price, of 16.67 dlrs a
  barrel, it had lost custom, he said but did not elaborate.
      However, Kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil because
  of its local and international refining facilities and its own
  distribution network abroad, he added.
      He reaffirmed that the planned meeting March 7 of OPEC""s
  differentials committee has been postponed until the start of
  April at the request of certain of the body""s members.
      Ecuador""s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said
  last Wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted OPEC to assign
  a lower official price for its crude, and was to seek this at
  talks this month of opec""s pricing committee.
      Referring to pressure by oil companies on OPEC members, in
  apparent reference to difficulties faced by Qatar, he said: ""We
  expected such pressure. It will continue through March and
  April."" But he expected the situation would later improve.

training/12002,"SHULTZ USSR TRIP FUELS TALK OF EEP WHEAT OFFER
  Speculation the United States will
  offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union appears to have
  reached a new level of intensity in the run-up to Secretary of
  State George Shultz' visit later this month to Moscow.
      Rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheat
  markets since officials from the two countries held their
  customary, semi-annual grain talks in February. Moscow's
  decision at that time to reenter the U.S. corn market
  strengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects.
      Shultz is set to arrive in Moscow April 13.
      Shultz' statement two weeks ago that he would not stand in
  the way of a wheat subsidy offer under the Export Enhancement
  Program, EEP, coupled with the announcement of his visit to
  Moscow, was interpreted by many grain trade representatives
  here as a clear signal that the Reagan administration was
  preparing an offer.
      Administration officials -- in and out of the U.S.
  Agriculture Department -- have been extremely tight-lipped
  about the prospects of a subsidy offer.
      But USDA officials for the most part have abandoned the
  contention the proposal is dormant, suggesting that an offer,
  while not a ""done deal,"" is a live possibility.
      Prominent U.S. grain trade representatives -- many of whom
  asked not to be identified -- continue to maintain that an
  offer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent.
      Others, who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible,
  are saying they would not rule one out.
      Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., yesterday went so far as to
  predict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten days
  to two weeks.
      Aides to Roberts said he had spoken to Republican leaders
  who had been in contact with administration officials.
      Richard Fritz, director of international marketing at U.S.
  Wheat Associates, said he was confident an export enhancement
  offer would be made by the middle of this month.
      Fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would end
  up being close to the offer Washington made Peking earlier this
  year when USDA approved subsidies to China of around 36 dlrs
  per tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat.
      Some grain trade representatives say a four-mln-tonne wheat
  subsidy offer might help stimulate more Soviet purchases of
  U.S. corn and open the door to U.S. sales of soybeans.
      As ever, one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat deal
  would appear to be price.
      Last summer the administration took the controversial step
  of offering the Soviets subsidized wheat -- but were
  embarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the grounds
  that the 15-dlr-per-tonne subsidy still left U.S. wheat prices
  far above world market prices.
      The administration's decision to set the subsidy level up
  front instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be a
  means of controlling the price while attempting to dampen
  criticism, grain trade sources said.
      Nonetheless, the pricing procedure did not prevent Shultz
  from saying the Soviets were ""chortling"" because Washington was
  offering Soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available to
  U.S. housewives.
      The conventional wisdom among grain trade representatives
  here is that a general warming of relations between the two
  countries since last summer, combined with continued hard times
  in the U.S. grain belt, would favor a subsidy offer.
      In addition, the USSR has made it clear it would consider
  buying U.S. wheat if it were priced more competitively.
      However, observers have not forgotten the circumstances
  surrounding the administration's announcement of the wheat
  subsidy offer last summer.
      Up until the time of the announcment, congressional and
  industry leaders were led to believe the White House had
  decided to expand the Export Enhancement Program to include not
  only the Soviets, but also a much broader list of countries.
      Instead, the administration scaled back the offer to
  include only the Soviets.
      That last-minute change of heart adds a measure of
  uncertainty even to the predictions of those most convinced
  that the administration will not now pass up the opportunity to
  sell four mln tonnes of wheat to the Soviet Union.

  Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc said that
  relatively stable oil prices and the bank's planned merger with
  Chemical New York Corp &lt;CHL> would help 1987 earnings increase
  from last year's profits of 20 mln dlrs.
      Texas Commerce chairman Ben Love, in an interview with
  Reuters, did not elaborate on how much the bank expected
  earnings to increase.
      ""We would anticipate that this year would be an improvement
  over last because we are stronger,"" Love said, referring to
  Texas Commerce's pending 1.19 billion dlr merger with Chemical.
  The merger, which may be finalized as early as May 1, will
  lower Texas Commerce's cost of funding by an estimated 10 to 15
  basis points, Love said.
      The Texas Commerce-Chemical merger is the only acquisition
  by a major out-of-state bank since Texas lawmakers approved
  interstate banking effective January 1.
      Hard-hit by loan losses in energy and real estate in Texas'
  struggling economy, the only major Texas banks able to report
  profits in 1986 were Texas Commerce and RepublicBank which
  earned 54.0 mln dlrs. Allied Bancshares Inc &lt;ALBN> lost 17.6
  mln dlrs, MCorp &lt;M> lost 82.1 mln dlrs, InterFirst lost 326.5
  mln dlrs and First City Bancorporation &lt;FBT>, which is actively
  seeking a merger or other form of new capital, lost 402.0 mln
  dlrs.
      Love said Texas Commerce had turned the corner on its
  energy loan portfolio problems, but added that the bank's
  nonperforming real estate loans may increase during 1987.
      ""I think the tidal wave in energy has passed over us,"" he
  said. ""The fact that the real estate market is still moving
  away suggests there could be some continuing growth of
  nonperforming loans.""
      In 1986, about 42 pct of Texas Commerce's net loan losses
  related to real estate lending and 13 pct was due to energy
  loan losses. That compares to 1985 when only 17 pct of the
  bank's losses were in real estate and energy accounted for 43
  pct.
      More than half of Texas Commerce's nonperforming loans,
  which totaled 968 mln dlrs at yearend 1986, up from 840 mln
  dlrs the year before, were in real estate.
      Love said he believed the real estate loan problems for
  Texas Commerce and other major state banks would peak by the
  third or fourth quarter of 1987. Absorption of empty office
  buildings in Houston, which has a current vacancy rate of about
  30 pct, will be a gradual process that could take up to four
  years, he said.
      ""I think we may be beginning to stabilize this economy. Oil
  at 18 dlrs a barrel brings much more confidence than 10 dlrs a
  barrel,"" he said.
      Texas Commerce will retain its name as a separate
  subsidiary of Chemical and plans to aggressively expand its
  holdings throughout Texas, offering additional products to
  build up its consumer banking business, Love said. ""We are
  resuming what we did best for years -- an offensive position,""
  he said.
      In January, Texas Commerce acquired a failed bank in
  Montgomery County, adjacent to the Houston metropolitan area,
  and earlier this month opened a new bank in San Antonio. Texas
  Commerce plans to add more banks in San Antonio and in the
  Dallas-Fort Worth area where it currently has only 16 member
  banks, he said.
      One day after the Texas Commerce acquisition was announced
  in December, InterFirst Corp &lt;IFC> and RepublicBank Corp &lt;RPT>,
  both headquartered in Dallas, agreed to merge in a deal valued
  at 570 mln dlrs.
      The combination of former archrivals RepublicBank and
  InterFirst, giving the two banks a virtual lock on the Dallas
  banking market, has not changed Texas Commerce's expansion
  plans for the state's second-largest city, Love said. ""We think
  we can try to get a little part of their roost,"" he said.
      The Chemical partnership will also give Texas Commerce an
  edge in developing new consumer products, he said.
      ""We have always been a wholesale bank but we have more than
  one million customers all over the state. Chemical will show us
  how to take advantage of enhancing our consumer products,"" he
  said, referring to expansion of such existing products as
  credit cards and investment banking.

  Corn sales of 2,806,300 tonnes in
  the week ended March 19 were the highest level since
  mid-November, 1979, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
      The department said the USSR dominated the week's activity
  with purchases of 1.4 mln tonnes (which were earlier reported
  under the daily reporting system). Other large increaes were
  posted for Japan and unknown destinations, it said.
      Taiwan purchased 296,300 tonnes for the 1986/87 season and
  170,000 tonnes for the 1987/88 season, it said.
      Wheat sales of 317,200 tonnes for the current season and
  125,000 tonnes for the 1987/88 season were down about one-third
  from the preceding week and the four-week average.
      Wheat sales to China of 60,000 tonnes were switched from
  1986/87 to the 1987/88 season, it noted.
      Soybean sales of 483,100 tonnes were 11 pct above the prior
  week and two-thirds above the four-week average.
      Japan, the Netherlands, Mexico and Portugal were the main
  buyers, the department said.
      Soybean cake and meal sales of 289,400 tonnes were
  two-thirds above the previous week and the largest of the
  marketing year, with Venezuela the dominant purchaser.
      Sales activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of
  4,400 tonnes, as reductions for unknown destinations more than
  offset increases for Canada, the Dominican Republic and Panama,
  the department said.
      Cotton sales of 57,900 running bales -- 43,800 bales for
  the current year and 14,200 bales for the 1987/88 season --
  were off 25 pct from the previous week and 50 pct from the
  four-week average.
      Turkey, Thailand, South Korea and Canada were the major
  buyers for the current season, while Thailand, Britain and
  Japan were the major purchasers from the upcoming season, the
  department said.
       Sorghum sales of 178,800 tonnes were two-thirds above the
  prior week and 75 pct over the four-week average.
      Venezuela was the leading buyer it said.
      Sales of 41,800 tonnes of barley were 10 times the previous
  week and 10 pct greater than  the four-week average. Israel,
  Cyprus and Saudi Arabia were the main buyers, it said.

training/12887,"PAKISTAN NOT SEEN AS MAJOR WHEAT EXPORTER
  Pakistan is not emerging as a major
  wheat exporter as world market prospects are not good enough,
  Sartaj Aziz, Special Assistant on Food and Agriculture to the
  Pakistani Prime Minister, said in an interview.
      No exports are planned for the next 12 months or so and
  plans last year to sell one mln tonnes to Iran came to nothing
  because they could not agree a price, he said.
      Aziz forecast that Pakistan may have exportable surpluses
  of one mln tonnes or a half mln tonnes over the next few
  harvests in years when the weather is favourable.
      The government does not wish to increase output much above
  this because of low world prices, and the land would be better
  used for other crops.
      Aziz said the Pakistani government does not want area sown
  to wheat to increase from the current seven mln hectares. Some
  10 pct of that area which gives low yields could be switched to
  more profitable crops such as oilseeds.
      The aim is to concentrate on raising yields from the
  current 1.8 to 1.9 tonnes per ha to at least 2.5 tonnes per ha
  over the next five to seven years, he said.
      Aziz said the current 1986/87 crop, harvesting of which is
  just beginning, is expected to yield around a record 14.5 mln
  tonnes. This compares with a target of 14.7 mln and last year's
  yield of 14.0 mln.
      He said rains some six weeks ago helped the crop but more
  recent rains reduced prospects slightly.
      The long-term wheat production target is for some 17 mln
  tonnes by mid-1993, taking into account Pakistan's annual
  population growth rate of more than three pct. Current
  consumption is some 12.5 mln tonnes.
      The current wheat reserve is 2.5 mln tonnes, Aziz said.
  This compares with a minimum reserve commitment of one mln
  tonnes, which Pakistan will maintain at all costs, and a
  ""strategic reserve"" target of two mln tonnes.
      Despite the fact that stocks are a half-mln tonnes over
  target, the surplus will not be exported at present, he said.
      The government wants to keep an extra ""safety margin"" until
  it sees what effect the abolition of a 44-year-old wheat
  rationing system will have on domestic consumption. New exports
  will be considered only in about a year's time when the 1987/88
  crop can be gauged as well, he said.
      The new domestic policy, introduced on March 15, is for the
  government to supply unlimited quantities of wheat at two
  rupees per kilo. With other costs this means a price in
  Pakistani markets of between 2.30 and 2.50 rupees per kilo.
      Under the old system, introduced during World War Two and
  due to be phased out by April 15, some 50 mln ration cards were
  issued enabling poor people to buy wheat cheaply.
      Aziz said following the introduction of a government
  support price in the 1970s the system become so corrupted that
  only 20 to 25 pct of subsidised wheat was actually reaching the
  consumer, the rest being diverted illicitly to the mills.
      The ration system had also not had the stabilising effect
  on the internal wheat market that was intended, Aziz said.
      Prices have already begun to fall with the introduction of
  the new system. The wheat price in Karachi, the most expensive
  Pakistani city, had dropped from 3.11 rupees per kilo on March
  1 to 2.85 rupees on March 30.
      Aziz said he does not expect the change in system to have a
  major effect on total consumption, but it may encourage better
  use of side-products such as bran.

  Malaysia's central bank said it
  acquired a 59.2 pct stake in ailing &lt;United Asian Bank Bhd>
  (UAB), the sixth largest commercial bank in the country, to
  rebuild public confidence in it.
      UAB called for a rights issue last November to raise 152.49
  mln ringgit to rectify its capital deficiency following an
  accumulated loss of 107.61 mln ringgit at end-1985, the central
  bank, Bank Negara, said in a statement.
      But only 16.99 mln ringgit in shares was taken up by
  shareholders, mainly local Indian and Malay businessmen and the
  Indian Government.
      Bank Negara said it subsequently took up the unsubscribed
  shares, totalling 135.5 mln of UAB's new paid-up capital of
  228.74 mln ringgit.
      It said the shares, held in trust, will be eventually sold.
      The central bank early this week also announced that it had
  bought 49.4 pct stake in another troubled commercial bank,
  &lt;Perwira Habib Bank Malaysia Bhd>, after the latter raised its
  capital to 405 mln ringgit from 105 in mid-January this year.
      Bank Negara said it does not intend to hold on to the
  shares of the two banks.
      ""The injection of capital in PHB and in UAB including the
  recamp of management in these banks are some of the measures
  taken by the bank to strengthen public confidence in the
  stability of the these banks,"" it added.
      The central bank said it is invoking Section 39A of the
  Banking (Amendemnt) Act 1986 empowering it to grant loans to an
  ailing bank or to buy a stake in it.

      ""Our progress will determine how soon we can reinstate a

  couple of years never happens again.""
      The company has faced regulatory challenges to rates
  proposed to cover the cost of its Grand Gulf nuclear plant.
      He said Middle South's net income is expected to post
  ""modest growth"" over the next three years.
      In 1986, the company earned 451.3 mln dlrs or 2.21 dlrs a

  Gross domestic product is expected to

  Mohammad Syeduzzaman told reporters.
      Inflation fell to an estimated 12 pct this fiscal year from
  17 pct in 1981/82, he said last night.
      The World Bank and other independent sources have said
  inflation would be around 15 pct in 1986/87.

  600 mln dlrs this year from 425 mln in 1981/82.
      Foreign exchange reserves at end-June are projected at 680
  mln dlrs compared with 105 mln in 1981/82, he said.
      Syeduzzaman said the export target has been set at 900 mln
  dlrs this year against 626 mln in 1981/82. Commitments for
  foreign loans and grants total more than five billion dlrs in
  1986/87, against 3.54 billion five years previously, he said.
      The government's liberal industrial policy has attracted
  investment commitments totalling 250 mln dlrs, he said
      Foodgrain output is estimated at 16.4 mln tonnes this year,
  up from 16.12 mln in 1985/86 and 14.4 mln in 1981/82.
      Government officials have said Bangladesh must import

      The rate cut had been expected since the bank announced a
  money market intervention tender earlier today.
      Money market dealers said conditions seemed right for a

training/8664,"DOUBTS ABOUT ACCORD SEEN WEAKENING DOLLAR FURTHER
  The dollar is expected to decline further
  in coming days as scepticism mounts about the effectiveness of
  last month's Paris accord to stabilise currency exchange rates,
  senior foreign exchange dealers said.
      Following its fall today to a record 148.40 yen, dealers
  said they expect the dollar to establish a new trading range of
  147 to 150 yen before the market again tries to push it down.
  Behind the latest dollar fall lies the belief that last month's
  accord was no longer enough to stop operators pushing the
  dollar down, the dealers said.
      ""The recent remark by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker
  that the Paris accord did not set any target ranges for major
  currencies has cast a shadow on the agreement,"" said Koji
  Kidokoro, general manager of Mitsui Bank Ltd's treasury
  division.
      He said the market interpreted this as indicating the U.S.
  Would favour a weaker dollar and it had little intention of
  intervening to support the currency.
      ""This eliminated the widespread market caution against
  possible joint central bank intervention,"" Kidokoro said.
      Dealers said the dollar had gathered renewed downward
  momentum and that Bank of Japan intervention alone could hardly
  contain a further slide in the currency.
      They said the central bank bought between one to 1.5
  billion dlrs today, including direct purchases through brokers,
  and yesterday it might have bought a small amount of dollars
  through the U.S. Central bank in New York.
      Most dealers said they doubted the U.S. Federal Reserve
  would intervene on its own account to support the dollar, but
  some said this might occur if the dollar fell much below 148
  yen.
      ""If the dollar drops to that low level, it could reduce the
  flow of foreign capital into U.S. Securities, which the
  Americans don't want,"" said Haruya Uehara, chief money market
  manager of Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp.
      He said the dollar may return to around 152 yen next month
  when corporations reduce their dollar sales after they close
  their books for the 1986/87 business year ending on March 31.
      But dealers said the longer-term outlook for the dollar
  remained bearish. This was due to the lacklustre performance of
  the U.S. Economy, the continuing U.S. Trade deficit and
  Japanese delays in announcing an economic stimulation package.
      ""The Americans are getting frustrated at Japan's inertia in
  stimulating its economy,"" said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant
  general manager of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd's international
  treasury division.
      In the Paris currency accord Japan promised a package of
  economic measures, after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed, to
  boost domestic demand, increase imports, and thus reduce its
  trade surplus. The package was expected in April, but debate on
  the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of
  parliamentary business over the proposed introduction of a
  sales tax.
      In the circumstances the government had only a slim chance
  of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future,
  Dai-Ichi Kangyo's Tanaka said.
      Dealers said if steps are not taken to stimulate the
  Japanese economy protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress
  would grow and put more downward pressure on the dollar.

  The Finance Ministry has asked trust banks
  to moderate their dollar selling, trust banking sources said.
      A Ministry official told Reuters earlier this week the
  Ministry had recently surveyed foreign exchange transactions by
  institutional investors, but he declined to say whether this
  was aimed at moderating the dollar sales.
      Dealers said institutional investors were reluctant to sell
  dollars aggressively today partly because of the Ministry
  monitoring.
      One senior trust bank source said that while sympathizing
  with the Ministry position, the trust banks had to conduct
  their foreign exchange operations according to the dictates of
  the market.
      A Bank of Japan official said the central bank approved of
  the survey as long it was not used too forcefully.
      But another official denied local press reports that the
  central bank itself had asked investors to moderate their
  dollar sales. ""We are not legally authorized to do that,"" he
  said.
      A Bank of Japan official also said the central bank will
  renew its call on financial institutions to moderate excessive
  loans for the purpose of land and securities investment as such
  investments threaten to cause inflation.
      Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita had previously

  Financial and industrial holding company
  Nord Est plans to make a convertible bond issue for a total of
  400 mln francs, President Gustave Rambaud said.
      He told a news conference Nord-Est expected to receive
  approval from the Bourse supervisory body COB in the next two
  week, when terms would set according to market conditions.
      He said the issue was meant to boost capital ahead of new
  investments.
      Rambaud said the company would pay a 1986 dividend of 5.25
  francs, unchanged on 1985. Parent company net profit last year
  rose to 99.5 mln francs against 71.1 mln in 1985.
      Provisional consolidated profits were lower at 185 mln
  francs compared with 200 mln in 1985, of which 120 mln, against
  147 mln, was attributable to the group. He said the lower
  profit was mainly due to losses made by steel-tube maker
  Vallourec, in which Nord Est has a 12.5 pct stake.
      Rambaud said he forecast a 1987 parent company net profit
  before provisions of around 135 mln francs.

  Woolworth Holdings Plc &lt;WLUK.L> which
  earlier announced a 1986 pre-tax profits rise of 42 pct over
  1985, said its prospects for growth were very exciting.
      The profit figure of 115.3 mln stg exceeded a forecast by
  some 10 pct made during the hostile bid by Dixons Group Plc
  &lt;DXNS.L> last year and the company said the results were a
  major step towards the aim of making Woolworth the most
  profitable retailing group in the U.K.
      It aimed to produce growth from all its businesses and look
  for opportunities to acquire specialist retail businesses.
      Earlier this month the group said that tentative merger
  talks with the high street pharmacist &lt;Underwoods Plc> had been
  called off and recently announced a 19.2 mln stg recommended
  offer for &lt;Charlie Browns Car Part Centres Plc>.
      The B and Q Do it Yourself centres raised sales by 31 pct
  and retail profit by 37 pct, with its pretax contribution of
  45.5 mln making it the largest single component.
      The company said that the improvement had been achieved by
  substantial organic growth in existing stores as well as by the
  opening of a further 29 new outlets and enhanced margins.
      In other sectors, the Comet electrical chain raised retail
  profits by 46 pct to 17.4 mln stg, while the Woolworth chain
  reported a 120 pct improvement to 38.7 mln.
      The company said its property operations would increase
  substantially following the start of a joint venture deal with
  developers &lt;Rosehaugh Plc>.
      The defence costs against the 1.9 billion stg bid from
  Dixons resulted in a 16.0 mln stg extraordinary charge.
      The results were 10 mln stg up on most analysts forecasts.
  As a result, the group's shares rose strongly, peaking at 865p
  from last night's 842p before easing to 860p at 1155 GMT.

training/11861,"U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - PRIME RATE
  The prospect that other banks will
  follow industry leaders Citibank and Chase Manhattan in raising
  their prime rate is likely to cast a pall over the credit
  markets today, economists said.
      Bond prices had been making a smart recovery from two days
  of heavy selling when Citibank surprised the market by
  announcing a quarter-point increase in its prime rate to 7-3/4
  pct. Chase Manhattan quickly followed.
      Prices quickly fell by a full point, even though the dollar
  - the market's overriding concern of late - rose sharply on the
  news.
      Citibank cited the higher cost of money, especially in the
  Euromarket, as the reason for raising its prime rate.
      Part of this rise in market rates has been caused by fears
  of a tighter Federal Reserve policy to defend the dollar, but
  economists said it is too early to tell whether the Fed, whose
  policy-making federal open market committee, FOMC, meets this
  week, is already tightening its grip on credit.
      ""The Fed seems to have been a bit slow in meeting the
  banking system's reserve needs this statement period, but I
  wouldn't conclude anything until I've seen the Fed data,"" said
  Jeffrey Leeds of Chemical Bank.

  &lt;MTS Acquisition Corp's>
  28-dlr-per-share offering price for Caesars World Inc is
  thought to be much too low and is likely to attract other
  suitors for the hotel/casino company, industry analysts said.
      ""I think someone else will probably come in, or they (MTS)
  will have to raise their bid,"" said Marvin Roffman, an analyst
  at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.
      MTS, a company formed by Martin Sosnoff, Caesars World's
  largest shareholder, today began a tender offer, valued at
  725.2 mln dlrs, for all shares Sosnoff doesn't already own.
      ""I think the offer is too low by at least five points,""
  said Roffman, who described Caesars World as the operator of
  ""one of the finest casinos in the world.""
      Sosnoff, a New York investor, already owns 13.3 pct of
  Caesars World's 30.3 mln shares.
      Following news of the tender offer Caesars World's shares
  were trading at 27-7/8, up 3-3/8.
      A Caesars World spokesman said the company was declining
  comment on the Sosnoff move for the moment, but Caesars may
  issue a public statement after it has studied the offer.
      Roffman said Caesars World has considerable growth
  potential and he is forecasting fiscal 1988 earnings of two
  dlrs per share.
      Caesars World owns casino hotels in Nevada and honeymoon
  resorts in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains. It also controls
  Caesars New Jersey Inc &lt;CJN>, which owns an Atlantic City,
  N.J., casino hotel.
      For its fiscal year ended July 31 Caesars World reported
  net income of 41 mln dlrs, or 1.36 dlrs per primary share.
      The company reported second quarter net income of 12.6 mln
  dlrs, or 41 cts per share, compared with income of 7.5 mln
  dlrs, or 25 cts per share a year earlier.
      Daniel Lee, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, said
  that although Sosnoff's relatively low bid may attract other
  suitors willing to pay a higher price for Caesars, there is
  little likelihood that a competing bid would start a battle for
  the company.

      Ecuador had recently been pumping 260,000 barrels per day.

  Southwestern Bell Corp said that
  its planned acquisitions of cellular telephone and paging
  systems, including those of &lt;Metromedia Inc>, will result in
  some initial earnings dilution and an increase in debt ratio.
      In a letter to shareholders in its 1986 annual report, the
  regional Bell company did not indicate the degree of earnings
  dilution it expects from the acquisitions, which total some
  1.38 billion dlrs. However, the company said the rise in its
  debt ratio will be temporary and will leave its debt level
  within an acceptable range.
      In its 1986 yearend financial statement, Southwestern Bell
  listed a debt-to-equity ratio of 43.4 pct, down slightly from
  43.7 pct in 1985.
      In 1986, the company earned 1.02 billion dlrs, or 10.26
  dlrs a share, compared with 996.2 mln dlrs, or 10 dlrs a share
  in 1985. Revenues dipped to 7.90 billion dlrs from 7.93 billion
  dlrs.
      Southwestern Bell said it expects the new tax law to have a
  negative impact on its cash flow, due mainly to the loss of
  investment tax credits.
      By mid-year, however, the company said a reduced corporate
  tax rate should have a positive impact on its net income and
  cash flow.
      In addition, the company said it is projecting a 1.7 pct
  gain in customer telephone lines and a three to four pct
  increase in long distance calling volumes.
      Southwestern Bell said 1987 capital expenditures will be
  lower that the 1.97 billion dlrs spent in 1986, a year in which
  expenditures were held below budget.

  Salomon Brothers Inc said it raised

      Salomon analyst David Sutliff said in a statement he sees
  1988 earnings of 3.35 dlrs a share, up from an earlier forecast
  of three dlrs for the year. The outlook for 1987 remains at
  2.50 dlrs to three dlrs.
      Caterpillar's stock was down 1/2 points at 46-1/4.
      ""Although earnings will be poor for the next two quarters,
  we believe that profits could begin to improve in the second
  half - perhaps significantly - and should surge sharply through
  1988 and 1989,"" he said.
      Sutliff said improved results should come from four factors
  - higher prices, improved market share, reduced costs, and
  improved demand.
      The higher prices will stick because its Japanese
  competitor, Komatsu, has had to raise prices because of the
  increased value of the yen, he said.

  The Bundesbank is unlikely to change
  its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on
  Thursday, as exchange rates and short-term interest rates have
  stabilized over the past few weeks, money market dealers said.
      Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow's
  tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds will
  be credited on Thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining
  16 billion marks from the system.
      The tender was announced last Friday, because carnival
  festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday, and will
  close banks here this afternoon.
      Because of the disruption to business from carnival,
  minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are
  unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their
  needs at the tender.
      Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough
  liquidity in this week's pact to keep short-term rates down.
      But because of uncertainty about banks' current holdings,
  the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks
  this week, and top it up if necessary at next week's tender.
      ""I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount
  a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks,"" one dealer said.
      ""They would then stock it up at the next tender when the
  need is clearer,"" he added.
      An earlier pact expires next week, draining 8.5 billion
  marks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporary
  drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers.
      Banks held 52.0 billion marks on February 27 at the
  Bundesbank, averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month, just
  clear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement.
      Call money traded today at 3.85/95 pct, up from 3.80/90

  Asea Group, the diversified industrial

  earnings, after financial income and expense, to be flat
  compared with 1986, when it earned 2.53 billion Swedish crowns,
  or 371.1 mln dlrs.
      A company spokesman said 1986 results were boosted
  significantly by the booking of two large orders for nuclear
  power plants.
      This gain, he said, will be balanced in 1987 by a return to
  profitability by Asea's power transmission segment, which had a
  loss of 183 mln crowns, or 26.9 mln dlrs, last year.
      Currency conversions were made at 6.81 crowns to the dlr.
      The spokesman said the company has built up a strong
  backlog of orders that will contribute to earnings in 1988 and
  beyond.
      At yearend 1986, Asea's order backlog stood at 32.7 billion
  crowns, or 4.8 billion dlrs, up from 30.9 billion, or 4.5

training/1553,"FED DRAFTS CURRENCY, RATE SWAP RISK GAUGE
  The Federal Reserve Board voted
  unanimously to propose a formula for calculating the risk of
  interest rate and currency swaps as part of its ongoing effort
  to come up with a new capital standard for U.S. banks that
  takes into account the riskiness of a bank's loans and other
  assets.
      Fed officials said an identical proposal was being issues
  today by the Bank of England.
      The Fed set a 60-day period for public comment on the plan.
      The proposal adopted today addresses only the credit risks
  associated with interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange
  contracts and similar financial instruments.
      Previously, the Fed Jan. 8 proposed a series of guidelines
  for calculating the risk of other off-balance-sheet activities
  that banks would be required to take into account in
  calculating the minimum financial cushion they would need to
  maintain.
      Both guidelines set five broad categories of risk for loans
  and other bank assets and assigned to each a level of risk that
  would establish a bank's minimum capital needs.
      The additional guidelines proposed today would determine
  the amount of capital support required for a bank's current
  exposure for a given asset and the potential future exposure.
      The current exposure would be measured by the
  mark-to-market value of the asset, which would reflect the
  replacement cost.
      Potential future increases in the replacement cost would be
  calculated using credit conversion factors based on statistical
  analyses by the staffs of the Bank of England and U.S. banking
  regulators. Future exposure would rise over the life of the
  asset.
      The Fed staff said the risk gauge attempted to balance
  conflicting needs for precision and simplicity.
      They ignore, for example, the relative volatility of the
  particular currencies involved in exchange rate contracts.
      Board officials said the new gauge could increase the
  capital required of the largest money center banks, which are
  the principal participants in these types of activities.
      They cautioned the Fed board to take account of the
  potential impact of the plan on the ability of U.S. banks to
  compete in world financial markets.
      However, the staff concluded, ""The credit risks inherent in
  such contracts now constitute a significant element of the risk
  profiles of some banking organizations.""
      The Fed proposal would exempt all but the 20-25 largest
  participants in this market, on grounds the benefits of
  including the smaller banks would be outweighed by costs.
      Also excluded would be interest rate and foreign exchange
  contracts traded on organized exchanges.
      Governor Martha Seger said she was concerned that Japan was
  not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new capital
  rules.

training/6959,"AUSTRALIAN EXPORTS HELPING TO BOOST GDP
  The strong contribution of exports to
  the growth in Australia's gross domestic product (GDP) in the
  fourth quarter of 1986 was a significant and welcome feature of
  the data, private economists polled by Reuters said.
      Real GDP rose 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986, after
  rising 0.2 pct in the third quarter and falling 1.1 pct a year
  earlier.
      Equally significant was the decline in both private and
  government spending, they said.
      Exports of goods and services rose 13 pct in the fourth
  quarter, while imports rose only 2.9 pct, Statistics Bureau
  figures show. Consumer spending declined 0.6 pct and government
  spending by 0.2.
      Bob Edgar of the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group
  Ltd said the government's aim of reducing the current account
  deficit by boosting exports and lowering consumption to cut
  imports appeared to be working.
      However, he cautioned that care must be taken to keep
  growth restrained because if it accelerated too fast imports
  would increase and worsen the balance of payments.
      Andre Morony of Bankers Trust Australia Ltd added the
  result was positive because growth was export-driven.
      But he said the GDP rise came as no surprise given the
  growth in exports disclosed in other statistics.
      The economists' comments were echoed by Treasurer Paul
  Keating in a statement issued in Canberra.
      Keating said the figures showed encouraging trends for a
  reduction in the current account deficit, notably the decline
  in domestic demand and the strong increase in exports.
      A further 3.5 pct fall in the terms of trade in the quarter
  underscored the need to continue restraint in wages, prices and
  public sector spending and borrowing to improve Australia's
  competitiveness, he said.
      ""It is clear that through the continued application of that
  strategy Australia will make the necessary adjustments in its
  external accounts and return to a more sustainable growth
  pattern,"" he added.

training/7471,"SHULTZ NOT OPPOSED TO WHEAT SUBSIDY TO SOVIETS
  Secretary of State George Shultz has
  decided not to oppose any U.S. wheat subsidy offer to the
  Soviet Union and has left the final decision on whether to sell
  subsidized wheat to Moscow up to President Reagan and the
  Agriculture Department, a State Department official said.
      ""Shultz feels like he fought the battle against a subsidy
  last summer, and he's not going to the mat again. It's now
  basically the USDA who has to make their decisions as to what
  they want to do,"" the official said.
      If USDA decides to go ahead with a subsidy offer to the
  Soviet Union, he said, ""Shultz will not wage a vigorous
  campaign against it. He might not come out in favor of it, but
  he won't go to the President and voice his objections.""
      In an official statement clarifying Shultz's remarks
  yesterday to leaders of the National Association of Wheat
  Growers, the State Department said, ""Secretary Shultz expressed
  his belief that whenever possible, U.S. grain should be
  competitive on world markets, including the Soviet Union.
      The Agriculture Department is in the best position to
  determine whether consideration should be given at this time to
  extending to the Soviets a subsidy under the Export Enhancement
  Program.""
      Although Shultz will not oppose a wheat subsidy to the
  Soviets, there remain obstacles to another subsidy offer to
  Moscow, the State Department official said.
      ""Everyone in the government agrees that if there is a
  subsidy to be offered, we would not offer it unless we had a
  firm commitment from the Soviets that they would buy.""
      USDA does not want a repetition of last summer when the
  USSR baulked at its offer of four mln tonnes of subsidized
  wheat, the official, who asked not to be identified, said.
      The Soviets rejected the U.S. offer then on the grounds
  that the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy was insufficient to bring
  U.S. prices down to competitive levels.
      The Soviets want a higher subsidy offer this time, the
  State Department source said.
      ""What the Soviets want is something equivalent to the
  lowest price being paid by anyone in the world,"" he said.
      The Soviets argue that they are the best customer of the
  U.S. and that they are entitled to the best price, he said.
      Government and commodity sources also said there are
  elements in the USDA, most notably undersecretary Daniel
  Amstutz, who remain opposed to a wheat subsidy to the Soviets.
      ""Subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union is still not a
  foregone conclusion,"" the State Department official said.

training/3847,"DOLE SAYS 0/92 OPTION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED
  U.S. Senate Republican leader Robert
  Dole said Congress should consider legislation to apply the
  so-called 0/92 option to producers of major commodities.
      Dole told the National Corn Growers Association that he
  thought the proposal, supported by the Reagan administration,
  ""should be seriously considered"" because a refusal to do so could
  ""play into the hands of those who want mandatory controls"" placed
  on production.
      However, Dole did not say whether he would support the 0/92
  option, which would offer producers at least 92 pct of their
  income support payments regardless of how much they planted.
      The Senate Republican leader said the 0/92 option posed two
  problems. First, it is viewed, he said, by some as welfare. In
  addition, debate on the proposal could open up the whole farm
  bill, Dole said.
      Dole also repeated his call for an across-the-board export
  enhancement program, saying a subsidy offer to the Soviet Union
  could help improve U.S. relations with that country.
      Dole said that the United States has made the decision to
  trade with Moscow and that it's important to offer competitive
  prices.
      The senator predicted Congress would have to decide this
  year whether to require an expansion of the export subsidy
  program, which currently targets benefits to recapture markets
  lost to other suppliers which subsidize.
      Dole, who last year pledged to offer legislation to require
  a marketing loan for major crops but never did so, again called
  for the marketing loan for wheat and feedgrains.
      The Reagan administration's proposed farm policy changes
  ""are not going anywhere"" this year, Dole said, singling out the
  proposal to cut target prices 10 pct per year.
      Asked by reporters after his speech whether he sensed a
  shift in the State Department towards supporting an export
  enhancement initiative for the Soviet Union, Dole said he
  didn't see any change.
      Dole also said it would be a very close call in the Senate
  whether to open up the farm bill to general debate this year.
      Dole said he was encouraged by the selection of Republican
  David Karnes to replace the late Sen. Edward Zorinsky (D-Neb.)

  &lt;Equity Silver
  Mines Ltd> said it agreed to sell 6.6 mln shares of a new class
  of par value voting stock to Placer Development Ltd for 37.1
  mln dlrs, increasing Placer's stake in Equity to 74.5 pct from
  68 pct.
      The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and a
  vote by Equity minority shareholders at the April 23 annual
  meeting, the company said.
      Proceeds from sale of the shares, priced at 5.625 dlrs
  each, will be used to buy and deliver 4,985,000 ounces of
  silver to Placer, Equity said.
      Equity Silver said the silver remains to be delivered under
  its sale agreement with Placer, after delivery of its 750,000
  ounce minimum commitment for 1987.
      Equity said it arranged to acquire 4,985,000 ounces of
  silver at 7.40 dlrs an ounces, subject to selling the shares to
  Placer.
      Purchase and delivery of the silver to Placer will result
  in an after-tax gain of about 6.6 mln dlrs, Equity said.
      It also said the stock and silver transactions will create
  a 37,059,000 dlr fund out of which dividends will be paid when
  cash is available.
      The cash fund will enable Equity Silver to continue to pay
  dividends on its preferred shares and increase the likelihood
  that it may be able to pay dividends on its common shares, the
  company said.
      It did not elaborate on what common share dividends might
  be paid.
      The company normally pays quarterly preferred dividends
  totalling 619,000 dlrs from retained earnings, Equity Silver
  said.
      Equity Silver had retained earnings of 2,312,000 dlrs at
  December 31, 1986.

training/302,"WALLENBERGS FIGHT BID FOR SWEDISH MATCH STAKE
  Sweden's Wallenberg group fought back
  a bid by the London-based Swedish financier Erik Penser to
  secure a large stake in Swedish Match &lt;SMBS ST>, one of the
  companies at the core of their business empire.
      A statement issued by the Wallenberg holding companies AB
  Investor and Forvaltnings AB Providentia said they had taken
  over an option held by Nobel Industrier Sweden AB to acquire 33
  pct of the voting rights in Swedish Match.
      Thre Wallenbergs paid Nobel Industrier &lt;NOBL ST>, in which
  Penser group has a 72 pct stake, about 20 pct over the market
  price for the Swedish Match option, the statement said.
      Swedish Match's B shares open to foreign buyers closed at
  424 crowns on Friday. The A shares -- with increased voting
  rights -- closed at 450 crowns for the restricted and 455 for
  the free shares.
      The statement said the deal increased Investor's stake to
  49.4 pct of the voting rights and 14.8 pct of the share capital
  while Providentia is left holding 34.1 pct of the voting rights
  and 14.5 pct of the share capital in Swedish Match.
      The Wallenbergs' stake in Swedish Match had previously
  amounted to 52 pct of the voting rights in the company.
      The Swedish Match deal will cost the Wallenbergs about 400
  mln crowns, share analysts said, making it one of the most
  expensise moves the group has undertaken in the last four years
  to defend its far-flung interests from outside predators.
      The Wallenbergs originally sold Nobel Industrier, an arms
  and chemicals group, to Penser in 1984 to pay for buying Volvo
  &lt;VOLV ST> out of two other key group companies, Atlas Copco
  &lt;ASTS ST> and Stora Koppabergs &lt;SKPS ST>.
      Since then, the Wallenbergs were ousted as the largest
  shareholders in SKF (SKFR ST> by Skanska AB &lt;SKBS ST> and
  Frederik Lundberg wrested control of Incentive AB from them.
      Lundberg, a Zurich-based Swedish property tycoon, also
  managed to acquire a 25 pct stake in another Wallenberg
  company, the diary equipment firm Alfa -Laval AB &lt;ALFS ST>.
      During 1986, the Wallenbergs have been concentrating on
  building up their stake in Investor and Providentia to prevent
  any raid on the heart of their business empire.
      But analysts say the Wallenbergs' position in the
  electrical engineering firm ASEA AB &lt;ASEA ST> is also too small
  at 12.6 pct of the voting rights and there has been growing
  speculation that the group will be forced to sell off fringe
  interests to protect its core activities.

  Rumors that New York investor Asher

      Edelman had no comment on the rumors.
      A spokesman for Polaroid said the company had not been

  Securities and Exchange Commission about a stake in the
  company.
      ""There is some hope among investors that there will some

      Traders said it is conceivable that a trial date could be
  set or some progress made on an out-of-court settlement.
      The suit, filed by Polaroid in April 1976, charges that
  Kodak infringed upon Polaroid's instant camera patent. In
  October 1985, the court barred Kodak from selling cameras or
  film that infringe upon the patent, the Polaroid spokesman
  said.
      Ellmann said he feels it is highly unlikely that any
  progress will be made in tomorrow's hearing.

  Former Prime Minister Robert
  Muldoon, an outspoken advocate of a managed float for the N.Z.
  Dollar, said the currency is at least 10 pct overvalued.
      Muldoon said in a speech last night the exchange rate
  should be around 48 U.S. Cents instead of the current 57 cents.
      ""A reasonable value for the New Zealand dollar would be
  between 10 and 15 pct less and nearer 15 than 10. Perhaps
  around about 48 cents,"" he said.
      The Labour Party government removed exchange controls and
  floated the dollar two years ago when it was worth 44 cents.
      Muldoon has no rank in the opposition National Party, and
  party leaders, with an eye to general elections to be held by
  September, have rejected his calls for a managed float.
      He said the dollar was high because of ""grossly excessive""
  interest rates for government stock.
      ""I know of no other country which is implementing such a
  free floating policy,"" he added. ""There is widespread agreement
  internationally that we have no alternative to floating
  currencies in the short to medium term. But we need more
  effective methods of managing them so as to limit the
  volatility which has caused so much concern and damage.""

  The Bank of Spain provided 1,145 billion
  pesetas in assistance funds which bankers said reflected fears
  of fresh increases in overnight rates.
      The daily auction was the biggest of the year and comes
  after the previous record set last June 6 of 1,240 billion
  pesetas.
      A spokesman for one of Spain top five banks said higher
  overnight call money rates were expected in the short term in
  view of disappointing money supply figures for February.
      The M-4 money supply, measured as liquid assets in public
  hands, rose 16.7 pct last month against 8.1 pct in January and
  compared with this year's eight pct target. Money supply growth
  was 11.4 pct last year.
      The central bank on Tuesday raised overnight rates by a
  quarter of a percentage point to 14 pct on demand for 746
  billion pesetas. Rates stood at 12.1 pct at the start of the
  year and have been increased to drain liquidity on rising
  demand for funds. ""The policy is proving counter-productive and
  rates will have to come down in the long-term,"" the bank
  spokesman said in reply to Reuters enquiries.
      He said higher rates were fuelling an influx of short-term
  speculative capital from abroad.
      ""At least 800 mln dlrs of current excess liquidity in the
  system is convertible pesetas from West Germany and other
  countries with much lower rates,"" he said.

  Gulf Arab states must coordinate
  economic policies more closely before moving towards their goal
  of a unified currency system, the President of the Arab Bankers
  Association said.
      Hikmat Nashashibi told a news conference at the end of an
  Arab currency traders meeting: ""We have to start with
  coordination of fiscal policies as a prerequisite for a common
  system of currencies ... There is quite a substantial way to go
  yet.""
      He said only then would a unified Gulf currency system be a
  plausible project.
      The six nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- Saudi
  Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab
  Emirates --  have held a series of meetings this year to
  examine linking their currencies to a single peg in a system
  which bankers say could be modelled on the European Monetary
  System (EMS).
      At present, five currencies are linked either officially or
  in practice to the U.S. Dollar, while the Kuwaiti dinar is
  pegged to a trade-weighted basket of currencies.
      A common currency system or EMS-style ""grid"" would, in
  theory, foster regional trade by providing a basis for stable
  exchange rates, but Nashashibi said inter-Arab trade is at a
  very low ebb and capital flows between Gulf states remain
  small. ""Capital markets in the Arab world are still in their
  infancy,"" he said.
      Nashashibi said lack of experience among Arab banks, a
  paucity of financial instruments and a legal framework that
  often does not recognise the western banking concept of
  interest have hampered the growth of Arab markets.

training/5244,"MEES SAYS SECOND WEEK MARCH OPEC OUTPUT 14 MLN BPD
  OPEC produced only about 14 mln bpd of
  oil in the second week of March -- 1.8 mln bpd below its
  ceiling -- largely because of pipeline problems in Turkey and
  Ecuador, the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) estimated.
      A landslide breached Iraq's one mln bpd pipeline through
  Turkey on March 6 for a week, and earthquakes in Ecuador have
  shut down its export pipeline for four to five months. Ecuador
  has an OPEC quota of 210,000 bpd.
      MEES put Saudi Arabian output at 2.9 mln bpd in the first
  week of March and 3.1 mln bpd in the second, in addition to
  output from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
      MEES said Saudi Arabia was pumping more than 300,000 bpd of
  its total production into floating storage.
      Saudi Oil Minister Hisham Nazer told Reuters and the
  television news agency Visnews yesterday that Saudi output,
  including Neutral Zone production, was around three mln bpd.
      The Cyprus-based newsletter also said authoritative Libyan
  oil sources said Libya was producing 850,000 bpd, compared with
  its 948,000 bpd quota, and that actual liftings are much lower
  than that.
      It said one major Libyan equity producer had partially
  stopped lifting its 55,000 bpd equity entitlement for March
  because Libya was insisting on official prices, but is still
  lifting 40,000 bpd of debt crude at official prices and a
  further 25,000 bpd of ""purchase crude.""
      It said small equity producers, with entitlements of only
  2,000 to 3,000 bpd, had also told Tripoli they could not lift
  at official prices.
      MEES said Iraq had sent a telex to OPEC and member
  countries calling for the formation of a committee to study
  what it said were inequalities in marketing potential among
  various members.
      The newsletter said the Iraqi letter indicated Baghdad was
  having difficulty selling crude at official prices.
      The Iraqi telex pointed out that some member countries
  export substantial volumes of oil that are not subject to OPEC
  price regulations -- exports of refined products, equity crude
  on which the margins are equivalent to covert discounts and
  ""other forms of hydrocarbons"" which are marketed in package deals
  with crude oil.

  ChemLawn Corp said its board
  rejected Waste Management Inc's 27 dlr-per-share tender offer
  and urged its shareholders not to tender their shares.
      ChemLawn said its board asked management and its financial
  advisor, Smith Barney, Harris Upham And Co Inc, to seek other
  purchasers of the company to maximize shareholder value.
      ChemLawn also said it adopted a shareholder rights plan, or
  ""poison pill,"" during a 120-intermin safeguard period its board
  adopted to deter attempts to acquire the company through any
  means other than an all-cash tender offer while it seeks other
  purchasers.
      ChemLawn also said it began litigation against Waste
  Management in federal court in Columbus, seeking injunctive and
  other relief.
      The suit alleges, among other things, that certain Waste
  Management officers and directors purchased ChemLawn's stock
  before making the tender offer. ChemLawn claimed such purchases
  possibly violated the officers' fiduciary duties and the
  Securities and Exchange Commission's insider trading rules.
      Last week, Waste Management made a tender offer to acquire
  ChemLawn for 27 dlrs per share or 270 mln dlrs.
      ChemLawn said its board was determined that Waste's offer
  was inadequate and not in the best interest of shareholders,
  and could ""adversely affect"" the interests of its employees,
  suppliers, creditors, and customers.
      ""Our board carefully reviewed Waste Management offer and
  concluded that it does not fully reflect the value of the
  company. We strongly urge our shareholders not to tender their
  shares to Waste Management,"" said Chairman L. Jack Van Fossen.
      ChemLawn said its rights plan is designed to protect
  shareholders against abusive tactics, such as ""market
  accumulations by Waste Management or others.""
      Under the plan, one comon stock purchase right will be
  distributed as a dividend on each outstanding share of ChemLawn
  common.
      ChemLawn said its rights holders can buy a share of its
  common for one dlr if any entity acquires 25 pct or more of its
  commmon, other than by an all cash tender offer for all its
  shares or an approved acquisition agreement by its board.
      It said the rights expire July three 1987, or 60 days after
  they become exercisable if later than that date. It said its
  board may redeem the rights for five cts per right any time
  prior to their exercise date.
      ChemLawn said the plan will not be triggered by purchases
  purusant to Waste Management's present tender offer.
      It said the dividend will be paid to shareholders of record
  March 20.

training/7326,"U.S. GRAIN TRADE CALLS SHULTZ REMARK SIGNIFICANT
  A statement yesterday by Secretary
  of State George Shultz after he met with wheat growers that
  U.S. agricultural products must be competitively priced was
  significant in that he recognized the importance of the Soviet
  market and the need for U.S. prices to be at world market
  levels, U.S. grain trade industry officials said.
      They said that Shultz's comments, while not explicitly
  endorsing subsidized wheat sales to the USSR, were noteworthy
  because they were not negative towards such action.
      In response to a query on what the State Department's
  position is on selling subsidized wheat to Moscow, Shultz told
  the leaders of the National Association of Wheat Growers that
  prices must be competitive if the U.S. is going to trade.
      The Soviet Union, the world's largest grain importer, has
  bought no U.S. wheat for more than a year, complaining the
  price was far above world market levels. A U.S. offer last fall
  to sell the Soviets lower-priced wheat through the export
  enhancement program, EEP, was also rebuffed due to the price.
      Shultz was said to be adamantly against the U.S. wheat
  offer last year and has been reported to be one of the major
  obstacles in making another subsidy overture to the Soviet
  Union, grain industry sources said.
      Intense speculation the U.S. might make a fresh EEP wheat
  offer to the Soviets has boosted grain prices significantly in
  recent trading sessions. Kansas City hard wheat futures rose
  another 2-1/4 cents by midday at 2.88-1/4 dlrs per bushel,
  while CBT March wheat was up 1-1/2 cents at 2.92-1/2 dlrs.
      ""I'm not sure this is an about-face, but it's clearly a
  recognition that unless we're competitive, we won't sell to the
  Soviet Union,"" said a lobbyst for a major commodity group.
      ""We have to be competitive. It's ridiculous to say that
  somebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same
  thing at a lower price somewhere else,"" Shultz told the farm
  leaders. ""That is our approach in negotiations with the
  Soviets,"" he said.
      If those comments do signal that the State Department is no
  longer opposed to the U.S. selling wheat to the USSR under EEP,
  it certainly improves the chances for an EEP wheat offer to
  Moscow, an industry lobbyst said.
      National Wheat Grower's officials were taking a cautious
  attitude towards the secretary's comments.
      ""His comments were not discouraging, but they didn't in our
  judgment promise any immediate action on EEP,"" an official with
  the wheat group said.
      The Wheat Growers official noted, however, that ""there is
  significance in that fact that we haven't seen any significant
  negative commentary on the idea of EEP wheat to the Soviets.""
      In a meeting with exporters this week, Secretary of
  Agriculture Richard Lyng refused to comment on their request
  that the administration offer subsidized wheat to Moscow, the
  officials said.
      An aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz, who is
  reported to be strongly opposed to EEP wheat to the Soviets,
  said that the Shultz comments ""are consistent with what he
  (Shultz) has taught for years as an economist,"" but said they
  don't necessarily relate to the Soviet Union.
      Amstutz could not be reached for comment, and an aide to
  Lyng said Lyng would not comment on Shultz's statements.
      But trade sources were hopeful that the Shultz comments may
  indicate some movement towards EEP wheat to Moscow.
      ""If he didn't say no, then there's a chance. This is
  potentially a positive development,"" a commodity source said.

      The company said it filed in the Federal Court in the
  Central District of California, charging the tender offer,
  which its board rejected, violated federal securities laws and
  federal margin regulations.
      The suit charges the offering materials are materially
  false and misleading and misstate and conceal material
  information required to be disclosed to shareholders.
      The suit also charges the offer is illusory and designed to
  manipulate the market in Caesars World stock to enable Sosnoff
  to sell the Caesars World stock he already owns for a
  substantial profit.
      The complaint seeks, among other things, to enjoin the
  tender offer and to require MTS and Sosnoff to correct false
  and misleading statements in the offer.
      Caesars World is expected to seek a friendly suitor,
  restructure operations, or buy back Sosnoff's holdings in an

training/6890,"ARGENTINE MAIZE, SOYBEAN FORECASTS FALL
  Argentine grain growers reduced
  their estimates for maize and soybean production in the current
  harvest in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.
      Soybean production for 1986/87 is now estimated to reach
  between 7.7 and eight mln tonnes, versus 7.8 to 8.2 mln tonnes
  estimated a week ago and eight to 8.4 mln tonnes estimated in
  mid-February.
      But even the lowest of those estimates would be 8.5 to 12.7
  pct greater than last year's total of 7.1 mln tonnes, according
  to official figures, and would be a new record.
      The total area planted with soybeans for this harvest was a
  record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares and increased 10.8 to 13.8 pct
  compared to the 3.3 mln hectares planted last year.
      The change in yield estimates is due to very high
  temperatures and inadequate rainfall since early in the year in
  the soybean-producing belt of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and
  northern Buenos Aires province.
      The heat and lack of rain combined to leave many soybean
  pods empty, especially in Cordoba.
      Intense rains in recent weeks did not affect crops, since
  rainfall was slight in most main soybean-producing areas.
      Rains in the week to yesterday were isolated and weak in
  Buenos Aires province, totalling between one and 10 mm. There
  was no recorded rain in other grain-producing provinces.
      With clear skies and seasonable temperatures, fields were
  able to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recent
  weeks, allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize,
  sunflower and sorghum harvesting.
      Crops were considered in generally good condition, though
  it is still too early to judge whether the intense rains of
  recent weeks caused any long-term damage.
      The maize harvest advanced to between 20 and 22 pct of the
  total area planted, compared to 13 to 15 pct a week ago.
      Total area planted with maize for this harvest stood at
  3.58 to 3.78 mln hectares, down two to seven pct from the 3.85
  mln hectares planted in the previous harvest.
      Total production for the current maize harvest is expected
  to reach between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes, versus 10 to 10.2 mln
  tonnes estimated a week ago. The new figure is 21.1 to 22.7 pct
  lower than the 12.8 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest,
  according to official figures.
      The sunflower harvest advanced to between 20 and 23 pct of
  total planted area, versus 15 to 18 pct a week ago.
      Total area planted with sunflower for this harvest was two
  to 2.2 mln hectares, or 29.9 to 36.3 pct lower than the record
  3.14 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.
      The current harvest's volume was again expected to be
  between 2.3 and 2.6 mln tonnes, or 34.1 to 41.5 pct lower than
  last harvest's record 4.1 mln tonnes.
      Yields varied widely from area to area, and growers feared
  that heavy rains in recent weeks may have taken their toll on
  crops and, consequently, on total production volume.
      The sorghum harvest reached between nine and 11 pct of
  total planted area, compared to four to six pct a week ago.
      Total area planted with sorghum stood at between 1.2 and
  1.3 mln hectares, or 10.3 to 15.2 pct lower than the 1.4 mln
  hectares planted in the previous harvest.
      Estimates for total sorghum production this harvest
  remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes again this week, or 16.7 to
  22 pct lower than last harvest's total volume of 4.1 to 4.2 mln
  tonnes.

  of April 1 and continue until the U.S. is satisfied there is
  full compliance with the agreement.
      The group said action by Japan to cut back on semiconductor
  exports is not what is required.
      ""America's interests require that agreements be honored and
  that U.S. industries not bear the burden for the persistent
  unwillingness or inability of the government of Japan to
  deliver on its commitments,"" the trade group said.
      The White House Economic Policy Council is expected to
  discuss possible sanctions against Japan at a meeting scheduled
  for Thursday.
      The trade group said Japan has not lived up to the terms of
  the agreement last year which was aimed at ending Japanese
  dumping of semiconductors and at opening Japanese markets to
  foreign-based manufacturers.

  The Philadelphia Stock Exchange (PHLX),
  a leading trader of currency options, plans to extend its
  trading hours to serve Australasian and Far Eastern markets,
  exchange president Nicholas Giordano said.
      He told reporters the PHLX will open a new session between
  1900 and 2300 hours U.S. EST from the beginning of the third
  quarter this year.
      The PHLX is also opening an office in Hong Kong to serve
  clients in the region and educate financial markets about the
  advantages of currency options, Giordano said.
      Giordano was in Sydney to start an Asian-Pacific tour by
  exchange executives promoting the hedging benefits of the
  exchange-trade currency option market against existing
  over-the-counter option trading during the local working day.
      Currency options pioneered by the PHLX in 1982 had become
  an accepted means of hedging against foreign exchange risk and
  had grown in popularity, he said.
      The PHLX now offered options in eight currencies, including
  a new Australian dollar option, and traded an average 42,000
  contracts daily with underlying open interest of more than 30
  billion U.S. Dlrs.
      Giordano said the exchange had been impressed with the
  performance of its Australian dollar contract, which since its
  introduction last year had regularly topped the French franc as
  the third most popular traded option, with up to 8,000
  contracts traded daily.
      Having the Philadelphia exchange open during the
  Asia-Pacific market day would open new hedging opportunities,
  set a truer level for over-the-counter option trading, increase
  arbitraging opportunities and give corporations and treasuries
  access to a currency option market of much greater depth and
  liquidity with the security of a clearing house, he said.

  Call money eased to 3.75/80 pct from
  3.80/85 yesterday following a net injection of 6.7 billion
  marks at a rate of 3.80 pct in fresh funds from this week's
  securities repurchase agreement, dealers said.
      But rates were expected to rise toward the end of the week.
      A major tax payment period by banks on behalf of customers,
  payments for the federal railways loan stock and repayments of
  mark liabilities incurred by foreign central banks with the
  Bundesbank in the framework of the European Monetary System
  (EMS) are likely to significantly burden the system. Banks
  built up minimum reserves today, ahead of the expected outflow.
      The Bundesbank credited banks with a gross 15.2 billion
  marks, but some 8.5 billion left the system at the same time as
  an earlier securities repurchase pact matured.
      Dealers estimated the EMS related outflow as high as six
  billion marks.
      The Bundesbank declined to comment, but a spokesman said
  yesterday although the funds now due may be allowed to roll
  over, the possibility that other central banks may choose to
  redeem them meant a net infusion was needed.
      Dealers forecast tax payments of 25 and 30 billion marks,
  but much of it is expected to burden the system only next week.
      Banks' minimum reserve holdings at the Bundesbank totalled
  53.6 billion marks on Monday, averaging 54.0 billion over the
  first nine days of March.
      Dealers said although the figure was well above an expected
  requirement of around 51 billion marks, the expected outflow of
  funds was so large that banks might find it difficult to meet
  the requirement toward the end of March.
      No securities repurchase agreement is expiring next week,
  but dealers said the Bundesbank could offer fresh liquidity if
  conditions significantly tighten. ""The Bundesbank wants to keep
  rates around 3.80 pct,"" one dealer said.

  Anacomp Inc, one of the most actively

  earnings to be boosted by its planned acquisition of a
  micrographics company.
      Anacomp rose 1/2 to 6-3/4 on volume of 950,000 shares after
  trading as high as seven earlier.
      Howard Harlow, analyst at Whale Securities Corp, said
  Anacomp's earnings for fiscal 1987 ending September 31 could be
  doubled to 80 cts a share from the 40 cts a share he had
  forecast before Anacomp agreed to buy DatagraphiX, a
  micrographics firm, from General Dynamics Corp &lt;GD>.
      ""The company can earn 80 cts a share in fiscal 1987, maybe
  as much as a dlr a share, because of DatagraphiX,"" Harlow said.
  ""Most of the benefit will be in the fourth qtr because it will
  integrate the company in the second half.""
      Anacomp's earnings will be less if it has problems
  integrating DatagraphiX, Harlow said.
      A spokesman at Anacomp said the company expects to complete
  its deal for DatagraphiX later this month. She would not say
  how much it will pay for DatagraphiX, but noted that
  DatagraphiX contributed 10 mln dlrs in earnings to General
  Dynamics on revenues of 239 mln dlrs in 1986.
      Harlow said a fellow analyst at Whale Securities estimates
  that Anacomp will pay between 100 mln dlrs to 150 mln dlrs for
  DatagraphiX. ""The estimates on the street narrow it down to
  between 110 mln dlrs and 130 mln dlrs,"" Harlow added.
      Anacomp reported net of 2.8 mln dlrs or nine cts a share in
  its first qtr ended December 31, up from 301,000 dlrs or one ct
  a share.
      In Anacomp's fiscal 1986 it earned 4,073,000 dlrs or 13 cts
  a share.
      Whale Securities recommends buying the stock, Harlow said.

  World Bank president Barber Conable
  pledged the Bank's support to help Indonesia adjust to lower
  world oil prices, but said further deregulation of its
  protected economy was needed.
      Speaking to reporters after talks with President Suharto,
  he said he expected Jakarta to do more to liberalise the
  economy and deregulate trade policy.
      Indonesia, hurt by the fall in oil prices last year which
  cut the value of its crude exports in half, is the Third
  World's sixth largest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs
  from the World Bank in the past 20 years.
      Conable said the World Bank, which granted Indonesia a 300
  mln dlr loan last month to help its balance of payments, was
  prepared to back Jakarta in taking the right steps to adjust to
  lower oil and primary commodity prices.
      ""We are prepared to support those steps which we believe are
  consistent with the development of the Indonesian economy,"" he
  said.
      He said Jakarta's willingness to move quickly after last
  year's collapse in oil price saved Indonesia from some of the
  difficulties now faced by other countries.
      Indonesia devalued its currency by 31 pct against the
  dollar in September to avoid a balance of payments crisis, and
  has announced a series of measures since May intended to
  stimulate exports, encourage foreign investment and revitalise
  the economy.
      However, key monopolies in areas like steel and plastics
  and high tariff barriers remain in place.
      Conable arrived in Indonesia on Saturday and has since met
  14 Indonesian cabinet ministers to review the country's
  borrowing needs and the impact of falling oil prices on the
  country.

  I've ever seen it in six years in Washington,"" Baldrige said in

  The Adelaide Steamship Co Ltd &lt;ADSA.S>
  (Adsteam) said its one-for-five rights issue at 11.50 dlrs a
  share will raise 228.5 mln dlrs for general working capital and
  investment, both in Australia and overseas.
      The group announced the issue with its first half earnings
  and said in a statement that the rights issue will be followed
  by a one-for-four bonus issue.
      Adsteam's equity-accounted net earnings rose to 75.05 mln
  dlrs in the half ended December 31 from 55.68 mln a year
  earlier and interim dividend to 18 cents from 16.
      Adsteam shares eased to 14.20 dlrs from an opening 14.60
  and yesterday's close of 14.50 on the issue announcement.
      The issue will be underwritten by &lt;Morgan Grenfell
  Australia Ltd> and &lt;McCaughan Dyson Ltd> apart from the shares
  to be taken up by Adsteam's associate and largest shareholder,
  department store retailer &lt;David Jones Ltd>.
      New shares will not rank for the interim dividend but will
  rank equally thereafter.
      Adsteam said it expects to maintain an annual dividend rate
  of 36 cents on capital enlarged to about 149 mln shares by both
  issues from 99.36 mln.
      Adsteam said its diverse industrial interests generally
  performed well and its results, as the ultimate holding company
  and beneficiary, reflected this solid performance.
      David Jones, owned 49.2 pct by Adsteam, earned the largest
  associates' net of 57.38 mln dlrs in the half against 40.29 mln
  a year earlier, Adsteam's figures show.
      Wholly-owned and joint venture companies also did well
  apart from timber, building supplies and real estate, which
  returned below-budget profits due to the housing downturn.
      Adsteam said it sees 1987/88 as a year of reconstruction
  and consolidation with the capital base boosted by the issue.

  Clausen said he was ""absolutely convinced"" BankAmerica would

      ""Fundamental to achieving that goal is to continue to
  reduce costs dramatically, to get our arms around our loan loss

      Clausen said he doubts BankAmerica would be in a position

      He said BankAmerica will continue to reduce staff and

  adopted today by the government, allows the Finance Ministry to
  issue up to 14,600 billion yen worth of foreign exchange fund
  financing bills, government sources said.
      Foreign exchange dealers said the yen funds would be used
  to buy dollars, to prevent a further dollar fall.
      The government sources said the amount, covering the first
  50 days of the year starting April 1, accounts for more than 90
  pct of the 16,000 billion yen in bills incorporated in the full
  budget.
